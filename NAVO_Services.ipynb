The mission was primarily designed to study the variability of X-ray sources on time scales from sub-milliseconds to years. The maneuvering capability of the satellite combined with the high photon throughput of its main detector (PCA) and high quality of background prediction (thanks to PCA intrumental group of LHEA, GSFC) has also made it possible to construct maps of the sky in energy band 3-20 keV. During its life time RXTE/PCA has collected a large amount of data from slew observations covering almost the entire sky. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; We have utilized the slew parts of all RXTE/PCA observations performed from April 15, 1996-July 16, 2002 which amounts in total to approximately 50,000 observations. The exposure time at a given point in the map is typically between 200-500 seconds. The observational period before April 15, 1996 (High Voltage Epochs 1 and 2) was excluded from the analysis because during that time the PCA had significantly different gain and dependence of the effective area on energy. The data reduction was done using standard tools of the LHEASOFT with a set of packages written by M. Revnivtsev (HEAD/IKI, Moscow; MPA, Garching).&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The survey has several features. It has strongly different exposure times at different points on the sky that lead to strong variability of the statistical noise on images. Because of that the only meaningful representation of images is the map in units of statistical significance. After the detection of a source flux can be determined from the map in the &apos;flux&apos; units. Map resolution is determined mainly by the slew rate of the RXTE (&amp;amp;amp;lt;0.05-0.1&amp;amp;amp;amp;#176;;/sec) and the time resolution of used data (16 sec, Std2 mode of the PCA). Sources can be detected down to the level of ~6e&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-12&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; erg/s/cm&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, but at this level the confusion starts to play an important role.

Users of the SkyView Jar will be able to access this survey through the web but performance may be poor since the FITS files are 150 to 600 MB in size and must be completely read in.

Each of these is represented as separate survey, and an averaged survey over all bands is also given. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The all sky maps are presented in two forms, the significance maps and the flux maps. The significance maps are the count rate divided by the noise (sigma RMS) in a region of the map around the position. The noise is variable across the sky due to variable exposure and systematic noise. The noise is Gaussian and and the significances can be interpreted with the usual Gaussian probabilities. A threshold of 4.8 sigma for the blind detection of sources in the BAT survey corresponds to about 1 false detection on the whole sky. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The BAT flux map is scaled from the Crab rate in the survey and normalized to an assumed Crab spectrum of 10.4 E&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-2.15&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; photons.cm&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;/sec/keV. Due to the large number of randomly distributed gamma-ray burst pointings that contribute to any point in the image, this is an accurate characterization for the whole sky. The 4.8 sigma threshold in the 9-month survey covers 80% of the sky at flux threshold of 3.5x10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-11&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; ergs/cm&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;/s in the 14-195 keV band and covers 1/3 of the sky near the ecliptic poles at 2.5x10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-11&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; ergs/cm&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;/s.</td><td>https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=batsig&amp;amp;</td><td>https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>simpleimageaccess</td></tr>\n",

NuSTAR operates in the band from 3 to 79 keV, extending the sensitivity of focusing far beyond the ~10 keV high-energy cutoff achieved by all previous X-ray satellites. The inherently low background associated with concentrating the X-ray light enables NuSTAR to probe the hard X-ray sky with a more than 100-fold improvement in sensitivity over the collimated or coded mask instruments that have operated in this bandpass. Using its unprecedented combination of sensitivity and spatial and spectral resolution, NuSTAR will pursue five primary scientific objectives: (1) probe obscured active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity out to the peak epoch of galaxy assembly in the universe (at z &amp;amp;lt;~ 2) by surveying selected regions of the sky; (2) study the population of hard X-ray-emitting compact objects in the Galaxy by mapping the central regions of the Milky Way; (3) study the non-thermal radiation in young supernova remnants, both the hard X-ray continuum and the emission from the radioactive element &amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;44&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;Ti; (4) observe blazars contemporaneously with ground-based radio, optical, and TeV telescopes, as well as with Fermi and Swift, to constrain the structure of AGN jets; and (5) observe line and continuum emission from core-collapse supernovae in the Local Group, and from nearby Type Ia events, to constrain explosion models. During its baseline two-year mission, NuSTAR will also undertake a broad program of targeted observations. The observatory consists of two co-aligned grazing-incidence X-ray telescopes pointed at celestial targets by a three-axis stabilized spacecraft. Deployed into a 600-km, near-circular, 6&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;o&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; inclination orbit, the observatory is performing consistent with pre-launch expectations. NuSTAR is now completing its primary science mission, and with an expected orbit lifetime of 10 yr, the opportunity for proposing observations as part of the guest observer program is now available, with observations beginning in 2015. This table contains a list of (a) unobserved targets that are planned or have been accepted for observation by NuSTAR in the future and (b) NuSTAR observations which have been processed and successfully validated by the NuSTAR Science Operation Center. The data from these observations may or may not be public. The user should check the value of the public_date parameter to determine the status of a specified data set: only those ObsIDs which have a public_date in the past will have data publicly available. Observations with a public_date parameter value which is either blank or a date in the future are still considered proprietary. Such data sets have been ingested into the HEASARC archive but will remain encrypted until their public date.

Using an SBIG STL-11000 camera, 70 fields (each covering 40x27 degrees) were imaged from dark-sky locations in Smellinger\\.xml\\.outh Africa, Texas and Michigan. In order to increase the dynamic range beyond the 16 bits of the camera&apos;s analog-to-digital converter (of which approximately 12 bits provide data above the noise leve) three different exposure times (240s, 15s and 0.5 s) were used. Five frames were taken for each exposure time and filter setting. The frames were photometrically calibrated using standard catalog stars and sky background data from the Pioneer 10 and 11 space probes. the panorama has an image scale of 36&quot;/pixel and a limiting magnitude of approximately 14. The survey has an 18 bit dynamic range. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; The processing of these data used a custom data pipeline built using IRAF, Source Extractor and SWarp. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; The data used here were converted to three independent RGB color planes of 8 bits each and provided to SkyView as a single 36000x18000x3 Cartesian projection cube. To allow users to efficiently sample data in a region of the sky, this cube was broken up into 2100x2100 pixel regions with a 50 pixel overlap between adjacent images.

Images in cached regions, are generated much faster. Access to the WISE data uses the VO SIA interface maintained at IPAC. Even when data is cached, the SIA service must still be available for successful queries.</td><td>https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=wise&amp;amp;</td><td>https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>simpleimageaccess</td></tr>\n",

Data are also stored at lower resolutions at factors of 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, and 1/32, and in an all sky image with a resolution 1/256 of the higest resolution. An intensity map has been created as the ratio of the counts and exposure maps. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; These surveys combine the basic count and exposure maps provided as standard products in the Swift XRT archive in obsid/xrt/products/*xpc_(sk|ex).img.gz. The surveys were created as follows: &amp;amp;lt;ul&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;li&amp;amp;gt;All of the exposure maps available in the archive in mid-May 2017 were combined using the CDS-developed Hipsgen tool. This includes 129,063 observations for which both count and exposure files were found in PC mode. Three exposures where there was a counts map but no exposure map were ignored. A few exposure files had more than one exposure extension. 1,082 files had two extensions and 1 file had 3 extensions. The 1084 HDUs in extensions were extracted as separate files and included in the total exposure. The value of 0 was given to the Hipsgen software as the null value for the FITS files. This caused the CDS software to treat such pixels as missing rather than 0 exposure. &amp;amp;lt;li&amp;amp;gt; The counts data was extracted from the counts maps for each observation using &amp;amp;lt;i&amp;amp;gt;SkyView&amp;amp;lt;/i&amp;amp;gt; developed software. For any pixel in which a count was recorded, the corresponding exposure file was checked and if there was any exposure (in any of the associated extensions), then the count was retained. If there was no exposure in any of the extensions of the corresponding exposure file, the counts in the pixel were omitted. Once a count was accepted, the overlap between the counts map pixel and the pixels of the corresponding HiPS tile (or tiles) was computed. Each count was then assigned entirely to a single pixel in the HiPS tile randomly but with the destination pixel probabilities weighted by area of the overlap. Thus if several pixels were found in a given counts map pixel they might be assigned to different pixels in the swiftxrt\\.xml\\.output image. The HiPS pixels (~1.6&quot;) used were of substantially higher resolution than the XRT resolution of 18&quot; and somewhat higher than the counts map resolution of 2.36&quot;. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; A total of 183,750,428 photons were extracted from the counts maps while 15,226 were rejected as being from pixels with 0 exposure. There were 501 pixels which required special treatment as straddling the boundaries of the HEALPix projection. &amp;amp;lt;li&amp;amp;gt; The resulting counts tiles were then clipped using the exposure tiles that had been previously generated. Basically this transferred the coverage of the exposure tiles to the counts tiles. Any counts pixel where the corresponding exposure pixel was a NaN was changed to a NaN to indicate that there was no coverage in this region. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; During the clipping process 137,730 HiPS level 8 were clipped (of 786,432 over the entire sky). There were 12,236 tiles for which there was some exposure but no counts found. During the clipping process 2 photons were found on pixels where there was no corresponding exposure in the exposure tiles. This can happen when the pixel assignment process noted above shifts a photon just swiftxrt\\.xml\\.outside the exposed region but should be -- as it was -- rare. These photons were deleted. &amp;amp;lt;li&amp;amp;gt; After creating the clipped level 8 counts maps, level 7 to 3 tiles and an all sky map where generated by averaging pixels 2x2 to decrease each level. When adding the four pixels in the level N map together only pixels whose value was not NaN were considered. &amp;amp;lt;li&amp;amp;gt; Finally an intensity map was created by dividing the counts tiles by the exposure tiles. To eliminate gross fluctuations due to rare counts in regions with very low exposure, only regions with exposure &amp;amp;gt; 1 second were retained. A total of 30 photons were deleted due to this criterion. &amp;amp;lt;/ul&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; Note that while any sampler may in principle be used with these data, the Spline sampler may give unexpected results. The spline computation propogates NaNs thought the image and means that even occasional NaNs can corrupt the swiftxrt\\.xml\\.output image completely. NaNs are very common in this dataset. Also, if the region straddles a boundary in the HEALPix projection, the size of the requested input region is likely to exceed memory limits since the HiPS data are considered a single very large image.</td><td>https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=swiftxrt&amp;amp;</td><td>https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>simpleimageaccess</td></tr>\n",

SkyView treats HEALPix as a standard projection but assumes that the HEALPix data is in a projection plane with a rotation of -45 degrees. The rotation transforms the HEALPix pixels from diamonds to squares so that the boundaries of the pixels are treated properly. The special HealPixImage class is used so that SkyView can use the HEALPix FITS files directly. The HealPixImage simulates a rectangular image but translates the pixels from that image to the nested HEALPix structure that is used by the HEALPix data. Users of the SkyView Jar will be able to access this survey through the web but performance may be poor since the FITS files are 150 to 600 MB in size and must be completely read in.

The range of optical and UV filters can accomodate wavebands between 1700 and 6500 Angstroms. A full field image covers 17x17 arcminutes and at maximum spatial sampling is imaged onto 2048x2048 0.5&quot; pixels. A 1000 second observation can detect point sources to m=22.3 when no filter is used. The Swift Serendipitous Source Catalog (Page et al., 2015) detects sources down to m=23-26 for the six filters in very deep observations, but the typical limits are substantially brighter (~20-23 magnitude). &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; These surveys are mosaics of all Swift UVOT observations released between the start of the mission and July 2017. Data were extracted from the HEASARC archive from the UVOT products directory. Mosaics are provided in six filters and also with no filter, i.e., WHITE. The table below gives the number of observations and bandpasses for each of the filters. For each UVOT observation standard processing generates a counts and exposure file as a single multi-extension FITS file with a separate extension for each filter. To aid processing, these extensions were copied into separate files in directory trees for each filter. Four observations in which the exposure and counts maps did not agree on the filters used were omitted from the processing. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; Some observations were recorded with 0.5&quot; pixels while others were binned to 1&quot;. All 0.5&quot; observations (typically fewer than 10%) were rebinned to the larger pixels for the counts maps since the counts data scales with the pixel size. Since the exposure values are intensive and do not vary significantly based upon the resolution, these data were not generally rebinned unless it was needed to ensure that Order 9 Hips data were produced. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; The CDS Hipsgen software was used to generate Order 9 HiPS data (~0.8&quot; pixels) for both the Counts and Exposure images. The HiPS (Hierarchical Progressive Survey VO standard) supports multi-resolution mosaics. Any quantitative use of these images should note that the rebinning increases the total counts by a factor of ~(1.0/0.8)^2 ~ 1.56. This software uses a bilinear interpolation to generate HEALPix tiles of an appropriate order (18 in this case). &amp;amp;lt;i&amp;amp;gt;SkyView&amp;amp;lt;/i&amp;amp;gt; developed software was used to divide the level 9 counts maps tiles by the corresponding exposure maps to create intensity tiles. Pixels where the exposure was less than 5 seconds were left as NaNs. The lower order (8 to 3) order intensity tiles were then generated by averaging 2x2 sets of the higher order maps treating any missing maps or pixels as NaNs. A HiPS all-sky image was generated by averaged the Order 3 tiles. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; Only the Intensity HIPS files are presented in the SkyView web page directly, but intensity, counts and exposure maps are available for all seven filters. Note that unlike the XRT HiPS data, the exposure and counts maps have not been clipped. I.e., the source FITS files have been aligned with the coordinate system and thus contain large numbers of unexposed pixels with 0 values. These 0&apos;s are simply propogated to HiPS tiles. NaNs are returned in regions which lie swiftuvot\\.xml\\.outside any of the original source images.

(e.g., BAT-snr-1 or BAT SNR 1 or BAT SNR 14-20, or BAT-Flux-1, ...). An additional summed survey, BAT-SNR-SUM or BAT SNR SUM or BAT SNR 14-195, is also available, but there is no summed flux survey. In our Web interface only the SNR surveys are shown in the Web form. Users can get flux maps corresponding to a given SNR image from the results pages. The batch interfaces may directly query any of the surveys since the user chooses the names explicitly rather than from a selection box. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; The values displayed in the significance maps are the local signal to noise ratio in each pixel. The noise in these coded-mask images follows a Gaussian distribution with center at zero and a characteristic width (sigma) of 1.0. The noise is calculated locally for each pixel by measuring the RMS value of all pixel values in an annulus around each pixel and hence includs both statistical and systematic components. Known sources are excluded from the annuli. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; The signal in each pixel is taken from the flux maps. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; The flux values are in the native BAT survey units of counts/sec/detector. The detector is an individual piece of CZT in the BAT array with an area of 1.6 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-7&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;m&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; While the Swift mission is primarily designed to follow gamma-ray bursts, the random distribution of bursts in the sky means that these survey&apos;s sky coverage is relatively uniform with the exposure at any point varying between abbat\\.xml\\.out 6 to 16 megaseconds. The survey limits for source detection are abbat\\.xml\\.out 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-11&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; ergs/s/cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; over abbat\\.xml\\.out half the sky and 1.3x10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-11&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; ergs/s/cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; over 90%. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; These data replace the 9-month BAT datasets which we have retired. If you wish access to the older data please let us know. Note that for the 9-month data we provided access through the web page to the flux data and gave links to the signal-to-noise maps. Since the existence of sources is most easily seen in the SNR maps, we decided to invert that for this release. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; For the 8 band data, the source data were provided by the BAT team as 6 FITS files. Each of these contained the 8 bands in separate image extensions for a region centered at l=0,b=+/-90 or l=0,90,180,270,b=0, the centers of 6 cubic facets. However these data are not the classical cube-faced projections, e.g., as used in COBE data. The data on the facets overlap, so that this is just a convenient way to tile the sky. &amp;amp;lt;i&amp;amp;gt;SkyView&amp;amp;lt;/i&amp;amp;gt; separated each of the FITS image extensions into a separate file, but no other modifications were made to the data. The summed image was provided as six separate files.</td><td>https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=bat-flux-1&amp;amp;</td><td>https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>simpleimageaccess</td></tr>\n",

NEAT is designed to look for potentially hazardous asteroids, i.e., those whose orbits cross the Earth&apos;s.

Only data within a single NEAT image will be displayed. The system attempts to find the most recent image within which has a offset in both RA and Dec of less than 0.8 degrees. If no such image is found, then an image with the minimum offset is returned, or the search may fail altogether if there are no nearby plates. The NEAT telescope uses an array of 4 CCDs. The backgrounds of the CCDs may differ significantly. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; The NEAT survey covers approximately 30% of the sky. Extreme southern and low-Galactic latitude regions are unsurveyed. Coverage is otherwise particularly dense in the ecliptic plane. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; NEAT data consists primarily of groups of three images taken with separations of 20 minutes and almost identical positions. &amp;amp;lt;i&amp;amp;gt; SkyView &amp;amp;lt;/i&amp;amp;gt; will normally return the last of a &apos;triplet&apos;. The SkyMorph site can be used to display an overlay of triplets to look for targets which moved during the interval between images. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; A catalog of objects detected in the NEAT/SkyMorph pages is accessible through the SkyMorph pages. &apos;Light-curves&apos; from all images during which an object was in the NEAT field of view can also be generated. &amp;amp;lt;P&amp;amp;gt; The NEAT data values are in arbitrary density units.

One of the main instruments of the observatory was the French-Soviet hard X-ray coded mask telescope SIGMA (Paul et al.1 1991, Adv.Space Res., 11, 279). It was the first space telescope that used coded aperture technique for reconstruction of sky images in hard X-rays (35-1300 keV). The angular resolution of the telescope was approximately 12&apos; and the accuracy of a source localization is approximately 2-3&apos;.&amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; SIGMA discovered numerous interesting hard X-ray sources including GRS 1758-258, which is located only 40&apos; from bright soft X-ray source GX 5-1. It detected hard X-ray flux from X-ray burster A1742-294, which is very near to bright black hole binary 1E1740.7-2942. SIGMA set an upper limit on the hard X-ray flux of from the central supermassive black hole in our Galaxy.&amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; During the period 1990-1998 SIGMA observed more that one quarter of the sky with sensitivity better than 100 mCrab. The Galactic Center region had the deepest exposure ( approximately 9 million sec), with the sensitivity to a source discovery (S/N &amp;amp;amp;gt; ~ 5) or approximately 10 mCrab.&amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; A list of all detected sources with references to publications on them is presented in the paper of Revnivtsev et al. 2004, Astr. Lett. v.6. In these survey images (40-100 keV) all performed observations are averaged together. Transient sources that were discovered by SIGMA may not visible in the averaged image. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; This survey has some features that users should keep in mind. The SIGMA telescope is a complicated instrument and is strongly dominated by the accuracy of the background subtraction. The presence of a very bright source in the field of view of the telescope sometimes cannot be fully accounted for and as a result of it some &apos;ghost&apos; sources can appear. Such features can be seen in the regions near very bright sources like Crab Nebula, Cyg X-1, Nova Per 1992, Nova Mus 1991, Nova Oph 1993, and in the Galactic Center region. In addition to its nominal field of view (~17x17 deg) located around the optical axis of the telescope, SIGMA had another window of relatively high transparency of its shield, approximately 20-30&amp;amp;amp;amp;#176; apart from the optical axis. Becuase of this a very bright sources like Cyg X-1 can cause non zero illumination of the SIGMA detector if they are located approximately 20-30&amp;amp;amp;amp;#176; from the optical axis. The ring-like features caused by this effect, can be seen around Cyg X-1, and Nova Per 1992. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; The count rate of detected sources (or upper limits) can be roughly translated into mCrab using the fact that that Crab nebula gives the count rate approximately 2.8e&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-3&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; cnts/s in the units, provided in &apos;flux&apos; maps</td><td>https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=granat&amp;amp;</td><td>https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>simpleimageaccess</td></tr>\n",

The mission was primarily designed to study the variability of X-ray sources on time scales from sub-milliseconds to years. The maneuvering capability of the satellite combined with the high photon throughput of its main detector (PCA) and high quality of background prediction (thanks to PCA intrumental group of LHEA, GSFC) has also made it possible to construct maps of the sky in energy band 3-20 keV. During its life time RXTE/PCA has collected a large amount of data from slew observations covering almost the entire sky. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; We have utilized the slew parts of all RXTE/PCA observations performed from April 15, 1996-July 16, 2002 which amounts in total to approximately 50,000 observations. The exposure time at a given point in the map is typically between 200-500 seconds. The observational period before April 15, 1996 (High Voltage Epochs 1 and 2) was excluded from the analysis because during that time the PCA had significantly different gain and dependence of the effective area on energy. The data reduction was done using standard tools of the LHEASOFT with a set of packages written by M. Revnivtsev (HEAD/IKI, Moscow; MPA, Garching).&amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; The survey has several features. It has strongly different exposure times at different points on the sky that lead to strong variability of the statistical noise on images. Because of that the only meaningful representation of images is the map in units of statistical significance. After the detection of a source flux can be determined from the map in the &apos;flux&apos; units. Map resolution is determined mainly by the slew rate of the RXTE (&amp;amp;amp;lt;0.05-0.1&amp;amp;amp;amp;#176;;/sec) and the time resolution of used data (16 sec, Std2 mode of the PCA).

In these cases the source appears fuzzy due to the poor resolution of ROSAT near the edge of the field of view. This comes at the cost of a substantial reduction in the fraction of the sky covered. Counts and exposure maps are included for users who may need this information (&amp;amp;lt;i&amp;amp;gt;e.g.&amp;amp;lt;/i&amp;amp;gt;, to do statistical analysis). &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; The global organization of the surveys is similar to the IRAS survey.

Each of the simultaneous modes is listed in separate records within this table. For a given time interval, there are several records (partially overlapping in time), each describing a single configuration/mode. The BAT modes collect data for the entire FOV but also have the capability to record rates (tag mask rate) for up to a few specific sky positions (typically 3) that correspond to a pre-assigned target ID. It is possible that at least two or more of these positions do not coincide with the BAT or NFI pointing position and therefore the target ID does necessarily coincide with Target_ID of the BAT or NFI pointing position. This table records for the position (RA and Dec) and Target_ID parameters the correct values associated to each of the mask tag data.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xamin/vo/ssa?table=swiftbalog&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/swiftbalog.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>simplespectralaccess</td></tr>\n",
