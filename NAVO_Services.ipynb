PiGSS is a 3.1 GHz survey of radio continuum emission in the extragalactic sky with an emphasis on synoptic observations that measure the static and time-variable properties of the sky. During the 2.5 year campaign, PiGSS will twice observe ~250,000 radio sources in the 10,000 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; region of the sky with b &amp;amp;gt; 30 degrees to an rms sensitivity of ~1 mJy. Additionally, sub-regions of the sky will be observed multiple times to characterize variability on timescales of days to years. Presented here are the results from observations of a 10 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; region in the Bootes constellation overlapping the NOAO Deep Wide Field Survey field. The PiGSS image was constructed from 75 daily observations distributed over a 4 month period and has an rms flux density between 200 and 250 microJy. This represents a deeper image by a factor of 4-8 than the authors will achieve over the entire 10,000 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;. In this table, they provide flux densities, source sizes, and spectral indices for the 425 sources detected in the image. They identify ~100 new flat-spectrum radio sources, and project that, when completed, PiGSS will identify 104 flat-spectrum sources. In their paper the authors identify one source that is a possible transient radio source.

It covers essentially all the sky south of declination +27 degrees but largely excludes the Galactic Plane and the Magellanic Cloud regions. The latter zones have been the subject of other, specialist surveys. A few data errors in Version 1.00 have been corrected in the present edition (see below). This version of the Parkes Radio Source Catalog is entitled &amp;amp;quot;PKSCAT90 Version 1.01.&amp;amp;quot; The original Parkes radio catalog was compiled from major radio surveys with the Parkes radiotelescope at frequencies of 408 MHz and 2700 MHz. This work spanned a period of nearly 20 years and was undertaken largely by John Bolton and his colleagues. Since then, improved positions, optical identifications, and redshifts have been obtained for many of the sources in the catalog. Furthermore, flux densities at several frequencies have supplemented the original surveys so that the measurements now cover the frequency range 80-22,000 MHz. However, coverage at the highest frequencies is still sparse. Important contributions to the usefulness of the catalog have been radio data from the Molonglo 408-MHz survey and the 80-MHz Culgoora measurements of Slee et al. PKSCAT90 should thus be regarded as a compendium of radio and optical data about southern radio sources. However, at the moment, it contains only sources originally found in the Parkes 2700-MHz survey (see e.g. Part 14, Bolton et al, 1979, Aust J Phys, Astrophys Suppl, No. 46 and references therein.) The original radio survey data of the catalog and the optical identifications have been published in a series of papers in the Australian Journal of Physics (see above reference). The associated optical spectral data on which redshifts were obtained has also been published, mainly in Astrophysical Journal and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. About the completeness levels of the catalog in various parts of the sky: users should note that the sky zone between -4 and +4 degrees has been the subject of a re-survey and is now complete to 0.25 Jy. The author Alan Wright notes that &amp;amp;quot;PKSCAT90 was produced at a time when relational databases were in their infancy. In the future we anticipate making the individual data sources available separately -- through such search systems as SIMBAD -- rather than in an &apos;omnibus&apos; catalog like PKSCAT90. For both the Northern and Southern hemispheres, superior and deeper finding surveys now exist: the 87GB catalog in the North (Gregory and Condon et al. 1991, ApJ, 75, 1011, CDS Catalog VIII/14) and the PMN catalogs (Griffith and Wright 1993, AJ, 105, 1666, CDS Catalog VIII/38, available at the HEASARC as the PMN table) in the South.&amp;amp;quot;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=pkscat90&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/pkscat90.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

They detect 168 X-ray sources, 80% of which have stellar counterparts in USNO, Two Micron All Sky Survey, and deep FLAMINGOS images. These constitute the first census of the cluster members with 0.2 &amp;amp;lt;~ M &amp;amp;lt;~ 2 M&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;sun&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;. Star locations in near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams indicate a cluster age of around 2 Myr with a visual extinction of 1 &amp;amp;lt;~ AV &amp;amp;lt;~ 3 at 1.4 kpc, the distance of the Rosette Nebula&apos;s main cluster NGC 2244. The authors derive the K-band luminosity function and the X-ray luminosity function of the cluster, which indicate a population of ~ 400-600 stars. The X-ray-selected sample shows a K-excess disk frequency of 13%. The young Class II counterparts are aligned in an arc ~3 pc long suggestive of a triggered formation process induced by the O stars in NGC 2244. The diskless Class III sources are more dispersed. Several X-ray emitting stars are located inside the molecular cloud and around gaseous pillars projecting from the cloud. These stars, together with a previously unreported optical outflow originating inside the cloud, indicate that star formation is continuing at a low level and the cluster is still growing. This X-ray view of young stars on the western side of the Rosette Nebula complements the authors&apos; earlier studies of the central cluster NGC 2244 and the embedded clusters on the eastern side of the Nebula. The large-scale distribution of the clusters and molecular material is consistent with a scenario in which the rich central NGC 2244 cluster formed first, and its expanding H II region triggered the formation of the now-unobscured satellite clusters Rosette Molecular Cloud (RMC) XA and NGC 2237. A large swept-up shell of material around the H II region is now in a second phase of collect-and-collapse fragmentation, leading to the recent formation of subclusters. Other clusters deeper in the molecular cloud appear unaffected by the Rosette Nebula expansion.

Multiwavelength cross-correlations show that 20 sources are coincident with H II regions and/or supernova remnants (SNRs), seven have identified/candidate background galaxy counterparts, six are coincident with foreground stars and one has a radio counterpart. While the spectral and timing properties of the brightest sources were presented by Jenkins et al. (2004, MNRAS, 349, 404: Paper I), in the present analysis the authors apply an X-ray colour classification scheme to split the entire source population into different types, i.e. X-ray binaries (XRBs), SNRs, absorbed sources, background sources and supersoft sources (SSSs). Approximately 60% of the population can be classified as XRBs, although there is source contamination from background active galactic nuclei (AGN) in this category as they have similar spectral shapes in the X-ray regime. 15 sources have X-ray colours consistent with SNRs, three of which correlate with known SNR/HII radio sources. Another two are promising new candidates for SNRs, one is unidentified, and the remainder are a mixture of foreground stars, bright soft XRBs and AGN candidates. The authors also detect 14 candidate SSSs, with significant detections in the softest X-ray band (0.3 - 1 keV) only. 16 sources display short-term variability during the XMM-Newton observation, twelve of which fall into the XRB category, giving additional evidence of their accreting nature. Using archival Chandra and ROSAT High Resolution Imager data, the authors find that ~40% of the XMM sources show long-term variability over a baseline of up to ~10 yr, and eight sources display potential transient behaviour between observations. Sources with significant flux variations between the XMM and Chandra observations show a mixture of softening and hardening with increasing luminosity. The spectral and timing properties of the sources coincident with M 101 confirm that its X-ray source population is dominated by accreting XRBs. The authors cross-correlated the XMM-Newton source list with previous X-ray observations of M 101. For the Chandra observations detailed in Section 2 of the reference paper, they matched on-axis sources (whose positions are generally accurate to ~1 arcsec) to within the XMM-Newton 3-sigma errors. For off-axis sources, the decreasing Chandra positional accuracy to ~2 arcsec was also taken into account. However, given the large PSF of XMM-Newton (~6 arcsec FWHM), they also checked for any contamination from additional fainter sources detected only by Chandra by searching for sources that lie within 15 arcsec of the XMM-Newton source positions (this corresponds to the on-axis 68% energy cut-out radius used in emldetect). In total, 71 XMM-Newton sources were unambiguously matched to single Chandra sources within the 3-sigma errors, whereas the nuclear source is resolved into two sources by Chandra. These matches are listed in this table, as are additional sources matching to within 15 arcsec. For completeness, both the CXOU designations of Kilgard et al. (2005, ApJS, 159, 214) and equivalent source source numbers from Pence et al. (2001, ApJ, 561, 189) are given. M 101 was observed with XMM-Newton for 42.8 ks on 2002 June 4 (Obs ID 0104260101).

The sample of Galactic sources with S/N &amp;amp;gt; 4.7 sigma has an identification completeness of ~92%, which is valuable for population studies.

The authors present a catalog of the optical counterparts to the 3213 X-ray point sources detected in the XBootes survey. Using a Bayesian identification scheme, they successfully identified optical counterparts for 98% of the X-ray point sources. The optical colors suggest that the optically detected galaxies are a combination of z &amp;amp;lt; 1 massive early-type galaxies and bluer star-forming galaxies whose optical AGN emission is faint or obscured, whereas the majority of the optically detected point sources are likely quasars over a large redshift range. This large-area, X-ray-bright, optically deep survey enables the authors to select a large subsample of sources (773) with high X-ray to optical flux ratios (f&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;/f&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;o&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt; 10). These objects are likely high-redshift and/or dust-obscured AGNs. These sources have generally harder X-ray spectra than sources with 0.1 &amp;amp;lt; f&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;/f&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;o&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt; 10. Of the 73 X-ray sources with no optical counterpart in the NDWFS catalog, 47 are truly optically blank down to R ~ 25.5 (the average 50% completeness limit of the NDWFS R-band catalogs). These sources are also likely to be high-redshift and/or dust-obscured AGNs. The 9.3 square degrees region of sky chosen to match the area covered with the NDWFS was observed by ACIS-I on the Chandra X-Ray Observatory over a 2 week time interval in 2003 March and April. The data were taken in 126 separate pointings, each observed for ~ 5 ks. The CIAO 3.0.2 wavelet detection algorithm (wavdetect; Freeman et al. 2002) was used to detect X-ray sources in the total (0.5 - 7.0 keV) band data. A probability threshold of 5 x 10-5 was chosen as the best compromise between maximizing the completeness while minimizing the number of spurious detections. The X-ray catalog comprises 3293 unique X-ray sources with &amp;amp;gt;= 4 counts in the total-band images (Paper II). The authors expect only ~ 35 of these sources to be spurious in the full survey (Paper II). For the matching with cataloged optical counterparts, the authors only considered the 3213 X-ray sources that overlap with the NDWFS area. The authors include all multiply matched sources with &amp;amp;gt;1% probability of being the correct optical counterpart.

This table lists all of the triggers observed by a subset of the 14 GBM detectors (12 NaI and 2 BGO) which have been classified as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Note that there are two Browse catalogs resulting from GBM triggers. All GBM triggers are entered in the &amp;amp;lt;a href=&quot;/W3Browse/fermi/fermigtrig.html&quot;&amp;amp;gt;Fermi GBM Trigger Catalog&amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;gt;, while only those triggers classified as bursts are entered in the Burst Catalog. Thus, a burst will be found in both the Trigger and Burst Catalogs. The Burst Catalog analysis requires human intervention; therefore, GRBs will be entered in the Trigger Catalog before the Burst Catalog. The latency requirements are 1 day for triggers and 3 days for bursts. There are four fewer bursts in the online catalog than in the Gruber et al. 2014 paper. The four missing events (081007224, 091013989, 091022752, and 091208623) have not been classified with certainty as GRBs and are not included in the general GRB catalog. This classification may be revised at a later stage. The GBM consists of an array of 12 sodium iodide (NaI) detectors which cover the lower end of the energy range up to 1 MeV. The GBM triggers off of the rates in the NaI detectors, with some Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flash (TGF)-specific algorithms using the bismuth germanate (BGO) detectors, sensitive to higher energies, up to 40 MeV. The NaI detectors are placed around the Fermi spacecraft with different orientations to provide the required sensitivity and FOV. The cosine-like angular response of the thin NaI detectors is used to localize burst sources by comparing rates from detectors with different viewing angles. The two BGO detectors are placed on opposite sides of the spacecraft so that all sky positions are visible to at least one BGO detector. The signals from all 14 GBM detectors are collected by a central Data Processing Unit (DPU). This unit digitizes and time-tags the detectors&apos; pulse height signals, packages the resulting data into several different types for transmission to the ground (via the Fermi spacecraft), and performs various data processing tasks such as autonomous burst triggering. The GRB science products are transmitted to the FSSC in two types of files. The first file, called the &amp;amp;quot;bcat&amp;amp;quot; file, provides basic burst parameters such as duration, peak flux and fluence, calculated from 8-channel data using a spectral model which has a power-law in energy that falls exponentially above an energy EPeak, known as the Comptonized model. The crude 8-channel binning and the simple spectral model allow data fits in batch mode over numerous time bins in an efficient and robust fashion, including intervals with little or no flux, yielding both values for the burst duration, and deconvolved lightcurves for the detectors included in the fit. The bcat file includes two extensions. The first, containing detailed information about energy channels and detectors used in the calculations, is detector-specific, and includes the time history of the deconvolved flux over the time intervals of the burst. The second shows the evolution of the spectral parameters obtained in a joint fit of the included detectors for the model used, usually the Comptonized model described above. The bcat files and their time-varying quantities contained in these two extensions are available at the HEASARC FTP site. Quantities derived from these batch fits are given in the bcat primary header and presented in the Browse table, as described below. The main purpose of the analysis contained in the bcat file is to produce a measure of the duration of the burst after deconvolving the instrument response. The duration quantities are: &amp;amp;lt;pre&amp;amp;gt; * &apos;t50&apos; - the time taken to accumulate 50% of the burst fluence starting at the 25% fluence level. * &apos;t90&apos; - the time taken to accumulate 90% of the burst fluence starting at the 5% fluence level. &amp;amp;lt;/pre&amp;amp;gt; By-products of this analysis include fluxes on various timescales and fluences, both obtained using the simple Comptonized model described above. These quantities are detailed in the Browse table using the following prefixes: &amp;amp;lt;pre&amp;amp;gt; * &apos;flux&apos; - the peak flux over 3 different timescales obtained in the batch mode fit used to calculate t50/t90. * &apos;fluence&apos; - the total fluence accumulated in the t50/t90 calculation. &amp;amp;lt;/pre&amp;amp;gt; The fluxes and fluences derived from the 8-channel data for these bcat files should be considered less reliable than those in the spectral analysis files described below. Analysis methods used in obtaining these quantities are detailed in the first GBM GRB Catalog (Paciesas et al. 2011). Updates of bcat files will be sent (with new version numbers) as these parameters are refined. This &amp;amp;quot;bcat&amp;amp;quot; file is produced for triggers that are classified as GRBs (with exceptions as described below), and supplements the initial data in the trigger or &amp;amp;quot;tcat&amp;amp;quot; file that is produced for all triggers. The second type of file (the spectrum or &amp;amp;quot;scat&amp;amp;quot; file) provides parameter values and goodness-of-fit measures for different types of spectral fits and models. These fits are performed using 128-channel data, either CSPEC or, for short bursts, TTE data. The type and model are coded into the file name. There are currently two spectrum categories: &amp;amp;lt;pre&amp;amp;gt; * Peak flux (&apos;pflx&apos;) - a single spectrum over the time range of the peak flux of the burst * Fluence (&apos;flnc&apos;) - a single spectrum over the entire burst duration selected by the duty scientist. &amp;amp;lt;/pre&amp;amp;gt; Like the bcat files, the scat files have two extensions. The first extension gives detector-specific information, including photon fluxes and fluences for each detector, which are provided for each energy channel. The second extension provides derived quantities such as flux, fluence and model parameters for the joint fit of all included detectors. The scat files and their energy-resolved quantities contained in these two extensions are available in the Fermi data archive at the HEASARC. Quantities derived from these spectral fits are available in the Browse table, as described below and in Goldstein et al. (2011). The spectra are fit with a number of models, with the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum often determining whether a more complex model is statistically favored. The current set is: &amp;amp;lt;pre&amp;amp;gt; * Power law (&apos;plaw&apos;), * Comptonized (exponentially attenuated power law; &apos;comp&apos;) * Band (&apos;band&apos;) * Smoothly broken power law (&apos;sbpl&apos;) &amp;amp;lt;/pre&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;b&amp;amp;gt;Warnings&amp;amp;lt;/b&amp;amp;gt; The bcat and scat files result from two completely independent analyses, and consequently, it is possible that the same quantities might show differences. Indeed, 1) the fluxes and fluences in the &amp;amp;quot;scat&amp;amp;quot; files should be considered more reliable than those in the &amp;amp;quot;bcat&amp;amp;quot; files, with the official fluxes and fluences being those yielded by the statistically favored model (&amp;amp;quot;Best_Fitting_Model&amp;amp;quot; in the Browse table) and with the full energy resolution of the instrument; 2) in both the bcat and scat analyses, the set of detectors used for the fits (&amp;amp;quot;Scat_Detector_Mask&amp;amp;quot; in the Browse table) may not be the same as the set of detectors that triggered GBM (&amp;amp;quot;Bcat_Detector_Mask&amp;amp;quot; in the Browse table); 3) background definitions are different for the bcat and scat analysis (see References below). Finally, for weak events, it is not always possible to perform duration or spectral analyses, and some bursts occur too close in time to South Atlantic Anomaly entries or exits by Fermi with resultant data truncations that prevent background determinations for the duration analysis. There is not an exact one-to-one correspondence between those events for which the duration analysis fails and those which are too weak to have a useful spectral characterization. This means that in the HEASARC Browse table there are a handful of GRBs which have duration parameters but not spectral fit parameters, and vice versa. In these cases, blank entries in the table indicate missing values where an analysis was not possible. Values of 0.0 for the uncertainties on spectral parameters indicate those parameters have been fixed in the fit from which other parameters or quantities in the table were derived. Missing values for model fit parameters indicate that the fit failed to converge for this model. This is true mostly for the more complicated models (SBPL or BAND) when the fits fail to converge for weaker bursts. Bad spectral fits can often result in unphysical flux and fluence values with undefined errors. We include these bad fits but leave the error fields blank when they contain undefined values. The selection criteria used in the first catalog (Goldstein et al. 2011) for the determination of the best-fit spectral model are different from those in the second catalog (Gruber et al. 2014). The results using the two methods on the sample included in Goldstein et al. (2011) are compared in Gruber et al. (2014). The old catalog files can be retrieved using the HEASARC ftp archive tree, under &amp;amp;quot;previous&amp;amp;quot; directories. The values returned by Browse always come from the &amp;amp;quot;current&amp;amp;quot; directories. The chi-squared statistic was not used in the 2nd catalog, either for parameter optimization or model comparison. The chi-squared values are missing for a few GRBs. This is believed to be because of a known software issue and should not be considered indicative of a bad fit. The variable &amp;amp;quot;scatalog&amp;amp;quot; included in the Browse tables and in the FITS files indicates which catalog a file belongs to, with 2 being the current catalog, and 1 (or absent) the first catalog (preliminary values may appear with value 0).</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=fermigbrst&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/fermigbrst.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

By combining the data from six observations, a high sensitivity, greater than a factor of 5 with respect to recent Chandra observations, has been achieved. Kaplan-Meier estimators of the cumulative X-ray luminosity distribution, statistically corrected for non-member contaminants, were built by the authors and compared to those of the nearly coeval Pleiades cluster. 431 X-ray sources were detected, and 234 of them have as optical counterparts cluster stars spanning the entire NGC 2516 main sequence. On the basis of X-ray emission and optical photometry, 20 new candidate members of the cluster have been identified; at the same time there are 49 X-ray sources without known optical or infrared counterpart. The X-ray luminosities of cluster stars span the range log L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;x&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; (erg s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;) = 28.4 - 30.8. The representative coronal temperatures span the 0.3 - 0.6 keV (3.5 - 8 MK) range for the cool component and 1.0 - 2.0 keV (12 - 23 MK) for the hot one; similar values were found in other young open clusters like the Pleiades, IC 2391, and Blanco 1. While no significant differences were found in their X-ray spectra, NGC 2516 solar-type stars are definitely less luminous in X-rays than their nearly coeval Pleiades counterparts. The comparison with a previous ROSAT survey reveals the lack of variability amplitudes larger than a factor of 2 in solar-type cluster stars in a ~ 11 yr time scale, and thus activity cycles like in the Sun are probably absent or have a different period and amplitude in young stars. NGC 2516 has been observed several times with XMM-Newton during the first two years of satellite operations for calibration purposes. The observations used in this analysis span a period of 19 months with exposure times between 10 and 20 ks. All of these observations have been performed with the thick filter. In the combined EPIC datasets the authors detected 431 X-ray sources with a significance level greater than 5.0 sigma, which should lead statistically to at most one spurious source in the field of view.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=ngc2516xmm&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/ngc2516xmm.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The aim of this study is to provide an unbiased and quantitative description of the X-ray source population at these fluxes and in various X-ray energy bands. The XMM-Newton Medium sensitivity Survey (XMS) includes a total of 318 X-ray sources found among the serendipitous content of 25 XMM-Newton target fields. The XMS comprises four largely overlapping source samples selected at soft (0.5 - 2 keV), intermediate (0.5 - 4.5 keV), hard (2 - 10 keV) and ultra-hard (4.5 - 7.5 keV) bands, the first three of them being flux-limited. This study reports on the optical identification of the XMS samples, complete to 85 - 95%. At the flux levels sampled by the XMS, the authors find that the X-ray sky is largely dominated by Active Galactic Nuclei. The fraction of stars in soft X-ray selected samples is below 10%, and only a few per cent for hard X-ray selected samples. They find that the fraction of optically obscured objects in the AGN population stays constant at around 15-20% for soft and intermediate band selected X-ray sources, over 2 decades of flux. The fraction of obscured objects amongst the AGN population is larger (~ 35 - 45%) in the hard or ultra-hard selected samples, and constant across a similarly wide flux range. The distribution in X-ray-to-optical flux ratio is a strong function of the selection band, with a larger fraction of sources with high values in hard selected samples. Sources with X-ray-to-optical flux ratios in excess of 10 are dominated by obscured AGN, but with a significant contribution from unobscured AGN.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=xms&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/xms.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

Over 900 X-ray sources are detected within 20 arcminutes of the cluster central position (J2000.0 RA and Dec of 6 31 59.9, +4 55 36); 77% of these X-ray sources have optical or FLAMINGOS NIR stellar counterparts and are mostly previously uncataloged young cluster members. The X-ray-selected population is estimated to be nearly complete between 0.5 and 3 M&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;solar&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;. A number of further results emerge from the analysis: (1) The X-ray luminosity function (XLF) and the associated K-band LF indicate a normal Salpeter IMF for NGC 2244. This is inconsistent with the top-heavy IMF reported from earlier optical studies that lacked a good census of &amp;amp;lt; 4 M&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;solar&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; stars. By comparing the NGC 2244 and Orion Nebula Cluster XLFs, the authors estimate a total population of ~2000 stars in NGC 2244. (2) The spatial distribution of X-ray stars is strongly concentrated around the central O5 star, HD 46150. The other early O star, HD 46223, has few companions. The cluster&apos;s stellar radial density profile shows two distinctive structures: a power-law cusp around HD 46150 that extends to ~0.7 pc, surrounded by an isothermal sphere extending out to 4 pc with core radius 1.2 pc. This double structure, combined with the absence of mass segregation, indicates that this 2 Myr old cluster is not in dynamical equilibrium. (3) The fraction of X-ray-selected cluster members with K-band excesses caused by inner protoplanetary disks is 6%, slightly lower than the 10% disk fraction estimated from the FLAMINGOS study based on the NIR-selected sample. (4) X-ray luminosities for 24 stars earlier than B4 confirm the long-standing log (L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;/L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;bol&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;) ~ -7 relation.

Within the ANS photometric system, the UV magnitudes of different objects are comparable down to a level of 0.5-1.0%. Several studies on the intercomparison of all ANS data, and on the comparison of the ANS data with stellar models, with other UV satellites, and with the expected UV fluxes on the basis of ground-based information alone suggest that the ANS photometric system is well-established, and has, in particular, a linear dynamic range of at least a factor of 20,000. In these two respects, repeatability and dynamic range, the ANS UV instrument far exceeded all other UV missions then extant, e.g., TD-S2/68, OAO-WEP, and IUE.

In addition to the comprehensive tabulation of X-ray source properties, several other results were presented in the reference paper: 1. The X-ray luminosity function is calibrated to that of the Orion Nebula Cluster population to infer a total population of roughly 8000-10,000 stars in M17, one-third lying in the central NGC 6618 cluster. 2. About 40% of the ACIS sources are heavily obscured with A&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;V&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt; 10 mag. Some are concentrated around well-studied star-forming regions -- IRS 5/UC1, the Kleinmann-Wright Object, and M17-North -- but most are distributed across the field. As previously shown, star formation appears to be widely distributed in the molecular clouds. X-ray emission is detected from 64 of the hundreds of Class I protostar candidates that can be identified by near- and mid-infrared colors. These constitute the most likely protostar candidates known in M17. 3. The spatial distribution of X-ray stars is complex: in addition to the central NGC 6618 cluster and well-known embedded groups, we find a new embedded cluster (designated M17-X), a 2 pc long arc of young stars along the southwest edge of the M17 H II region, and 0.1 pc substructure within various populations. These structures may indicate that the populations are dynamically young. 4. All (14/14) of the known O stars but only about half (19/34) of the known B0-B3 stars in the M17 field are detected. These stars exhibit the long-reported correlation between X-ray and bolometric luminosities of L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-7&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;bol&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;. While many O and early-B stars show the soft X-ray emission expected from microshocks in their winds or moderately hard emission that could be caused by magnetically channeled wind shocks, six of these stars exhibit very hard thermal plasma components (kT &amp;amp;gt; 4 keV) that may be due to colliding wind binaries. More than 100 candidate new OB stars are found, including 28 X-ray detected intermediate- and high-mass protostar candidates with infrared excesses. 5.

The authors present a systematic analysis of all X-ray sources found in the 41 nova monitoring observations, along with 23 M 31 central field HRC-I observations available from the Chandra data archive starting in December 1999. Based on these observations, they studied the X-ray long-term variability of the source population and especially of the X-ray binaries in M31. The authors created a catalog of sources detected in the 64 available observations that adds up to a total exposure time of about 1 Ms. To study the variability, they developed a processing pipeline to derive long-term Chandra HRC-I light curves for each source over the 13 years of observations, and also searched for extended X-ray sources in the merged images. This table contains the point-source catalog of 318 X-ray sources with detailed long-term variability information, 28 of which are published for the first time. The spatial and temporal resolution of the catalog allows the authors to classify 115 X-ray binary candidates showing high X-ray variability or even outbursts, as well as 14 globular cluster X-ray binary candidates showing no significant variability. The analysis may suggest that outburst sources are less frequent in globular clusters than in the field of M 31. Seven supernova remnants (not included in the point-source catalog) were detected, one of which is a new candidate, and also the first X-rays from a known radio supernova remnant were resolved. In addition to 33 known optical nova/X-ray source correlations, the authors discovered one previously unknown super-soft X-ray outburst and several new nova candidates. A large sample of detailed long-term X-ray light curves of sources in the M31 central field has been obtained in this study (see Appendix B.1 of the reference paper), which helps in understanding the X-ray population of our neighboring spiral galaxy M 31.

The data analyzed therein allowed a significant spectral extraction on 148 objects and optical variability study of 57 AGN. The slopes of the hard X-ray spectra of Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 galaxies were found to be consistent within the uncertainties, whereas lower luminosities were measured for the more absorbed/type 2 AGN. The intermediate Seyfert 1.5 objects exhibit hard X-ray spectra consistent with those of Seyfert 1 galaxies. When applying a Compton reflection model, the underlying continua appear still the same in Seyfert 1 and 2 with photon index 2, and the reflection strength is about R = 1, when assuming different inclination angles.

One observation of each disc field of M 31 was taken using the EPIC pn and MOS cameras on XMM-Newton in January and June 2002. The authors obtained background-subtracted spectra and lightcurves for each of the 335 X-ray point sources detected across the five observations from 2002. They also correlate their source list with those of earlier X-ray surveys and radio, optical and infra-red catalogs. Sources with more than 50 source counts are individually spectrally fit in order to create the most accurate luminosity functions of M 31 to date. Based on the spectral fitting of these sources with a power law model, the authors observe a broad range of best-fit photon index. From this distribution of best-fit index, they identify 16 strong high mass X-ray binary system candidates in M 31. They show the first cumulative luminosity functions created using the best-fit spectral model to each source with more than 50 source counts in the disc of M 31.

About 20% of the ULXs have much steeper indices indicative of a soft, and likely thermal, spectrum. The locations of ULXs in their host galaxies are strongly peaked toward their galaxy centers. The deprojected radial distribution of the ULX candidates is somewhat steeper than an exponential disk, indistinguishable from that of the weaker sources. About 5%-15% of ULX candidates are variable during the Chandra observations (which average 39.5 ks). Comparison of the cumulative X-ray luminosity functions of the ULXs to Chandra Deep Field results suggests ~25% of the sources may be background objects, including 14% of the ULX candidates in the sample of spiral galaxies and 44% of those in elliptical galaxies, implying the elliptical galaxy ULX population is severely compromised by background active galactic nuclei. Correlations with host galaxy properties confirm the number and total X-ray luminosity of the ULXs are associated with recent star formation and with galaxy merging and interactions. The preponderance of ULXs in star-forming galaxies as well as their similarities to less-luminous sources suggest they originate in a young but short-lived population such as the high-mass X-ray binaries, with a smaller contribution (based on spectral slope) from recent supernovae. The number of ULXs in elliptical galaxies scales with host galaxy mass and can be explained most simply as the high-luminosity end of the low-mass X-ray binary population.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=chanulxcat&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/chanulxcat.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The image of this field made at 34 MHz reaches a noise level of 12 mJy beam&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, making it the deepest image ever obtained at this frequency. In total, the authors detect 392 sources in the 3C 295 34-MHz field image, covering an area of 52.3 square degrees out to a primary-beam attenuation factor of 0.4. From these and simultaneous observations made at other low-band frequencies, the authors derive Euclidean-normalized differential source counts. The 62-MHz source counts agree with previous GMRT 153 MHz and Very Large Array 74 MHz differential source counts, scaling with a spectral index of -0.7. The authors find that a spectral index scaling of -0.5 is required to match up the LOFAR 34 MHz source counts. This result is also in agreement with source counts from the 38 MHz 8C survey, indicating that the average spectral index of radio sources flattens toward lower frequencies. The authors also find evidence for spectral flattening using the individual flux measurements of sources between 34 and 1400 MHz and by calculating the spectral index averaged over the source population. To select ultra-steep spectrum (alpha &amp;amp;lt; -1.1) radio sources that could be associated with massive high-redshift radio galaxies, the authors compute spectral indices between 62 MHz, 153 MHz, and 1.4 GHz for sources in the Bootes field. They cross-correlate these radio sources with optical and infrared catalogs and fit the spectral energy distribution to obtain photometric redshifts. They find that most of these ultra-steep spectrum sources are located in the 0.7 &amp;amp;lt;~ z &amp;amp;lt;~ 2.5 range. The Bootes and 3C 295 fields were simultaneously observed on 2012 April 12 as part of a multi-beam observation with the LOFAR LBA stations.

They find 268 sources detected both in the X-ray and radio bands. The availability of redshifts for ~ 95% of the sources in their sample allows them to derive reliable luminosity estimates and the intrinsic properties from X-ray analysis for the majority of the objects. The present table lists the X-ray properties and redshifts of these 268 radio-selected sources. In the E-CDF-S area, the authors have two sets of X-ray data obtained with Chandra.

The authors used the entire EGRET gamma-ray dataset of reprocessed photons at energies above 100 MeV and new Galactic interstellar emission models based on CO, H I, dark gas, and interstellar radiation field data. Two different assumptions are used to describe the cosmic-ray distribution in the Galaxy to analyse the systematic uncertainties in source detection and characterization. The authors applied a 2-dimensional maximum-likelihood detection method similar to that used to analyze the 3rd EGRET catalogue (3EG: Hartman et al. 1999, ApJS, 123, 79, available as the EGRET3 Catalog in Browse). The revised EGRET catalog (EGR) lists 188 sources, 14 of which are marked as confused, in contrast to the 271 entries of the 3rd EGRET (3EG) catalog. The authors do not detect 107 sources discovered previously because additional structure is present in the interstellar background. The vast majority of them were unidentified and marked as possibly extended or confused in the 3EG catalog. In particular, the authors do not confirm most of the 3EG sources associated with the local clouds of the Gould Belt. Alternatively, they have found 30 new sources that have no 3EG counterpart. The new error circles for the confirmed 3EG sources largely overlap the previous ones, but several counterparts of particular interest discussed before, such as Sgr A*, radio galaxies, and several microquasars are now found outside the error circles. The authors cross-correlated the source positions with a large number of radio pulsars, pulsar wind nebulae, supernova remnants, OB associations, blazars and flat radiosources and they found a surprising large number of sources (87) at all latitudes that have no counterpart among the potential gamma-ray emitters. Sources found within a radius of 1.5 PSF FWHM of a very bright source, and/or with very asymmetric TS map contours, are not included in the primary list of EGR sources but are included as EGRc sources herein. The EGRc sources represent significant excesses of photons above the background that may be due to extended sources, or structures not properly modeled in the interstellar emission, or artefacts due to incorrect PSF tails. As noted above, there are 188 sources in this catalog: since there are multiple measurements for these sources corresponding to the various viewing periods, there are 1640 entries in the HEASARC&apos;s version of the Revised EGRET Catalog, corresponding to 1512 &apos;observations&apos; of the 174 primary gamma-ray sources plus 128 &apos;observations&apos; of the 14 confused sources.

This observational evidence is the basis of the radio/gamma-ray connection established for the class of active galactic nuclei known as blazars. In particular, the main spectral property of the radio counterparts associated with gamma-ray blazars is that they show a flat spectrum in the GHz frequency range. The authors&apos; recent analysis dedicated to search for blazar-like candidates as potential counterparts for the unidentified gamma-ray sources allowed them to extend the radio/gamma-ray connection in the MHz regime. They also showed that blazars below 1 GHz maintain flat radio spectra. Thus, on the basis of these new results, the authors have assembled a low-frequency radio catalog of flat-spectrum sources built by combining the radio observations of the Westerbork Northern Sky Survey (WENSS) and of the Westerbork in the southern hemisphere (WISH) catalogs with those of the NRAO Very Large Array Sky survey (NVSS). This catalog could be used in the future to search for new, unknown blazar-like counterparts of gamma-ray sources. First, the authors found NVSS counterparts of Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) radio sources, and then they selected flat-spectrum radio sources according to a new spectral criterion, specifically defined for radio observations performed below 1 GHz. In their paper, they also describe the main properties of the catalog listing 28,358 radio sources with spectral indices between 1400 and 325/352 MHz between -1.0 and +0.4, and their log N - log S distributions.

There are also contradictory results on the clustering of X-ray selected sources. The authors have studied the X-ray source counts in four energy bands: soft (0.5 - 2 keV), hard (2 - 10 keV), XID (0.5 - 4.5 keV) and ultra-hard (4.5 - 7.5 keV) in order to evaluate the contribution of sources at different fluxes to the X-ray background. They have also studied the angular clustering of X-ray sources in those bands. AXIS (An XMM International Survey) is a survey of 36 high Galactic latitude XMM observations covering 4.8 square degrees in the Northern sky and containing 1433 serendipitous X-ray sources detected with 5-sigma significance. This survey has similar depth to the XMM catalogs and therefore serves as a pathfinder to explore their possibilities. The authors in their paper combined this survey with shallower and deeper surveys, and fitted the source counts with a Maximum Likelihood technique. Using only AXIS sources they studied the angular correlation using a novel robust technique. The AXIS source counts results are compatible with most previous samples in the soft, XID, ultra-hard and hard bands. This study has improved on previous results in the hard band. The fractions of the XRB resolved in the surveys used in this work are 87%, 85%, 60% and 25% in the soft, hard, XID and ultra-hard bands, respectively. Extrapolation of the source counts to zero flux is not sufficient to saturate the XRB intensity. Only galaxies and/or absorbed AGN could contribute the remaining unresolved XRB intensity. These results are compatible, within the errors, with recent revisions of the XRB intensity in the soft and hard bands. The maximum fractional contribution to the XRB comes from fluxes within about a decade of the break in the source counts (~10^-14 cgs), reaching ~50% of the total in the soft and hard bands. Angular clustering (widely distributed over the sky and not confined to a few deep fields) is detected at 99-99.9% significance in the soft and XID bands, with no detection in the hard and ultra-hard band (probably due to the smaller number of sources). The authors cannot confirm the detection of significantly stronger clustering in the hard-spectrum hard sources. Medium-depth surveys such as AXIS are essential to determine the evolution of the X-ray emission in the Universe below 10 keV. Included here are the basic data for the 2560 X-ray sources in the reference paper which satified the selection criteria of having an emldetect detection likelihood &amp;amp;gt;= 10 (the default value) in at least one band, namely: (i) XMM-Newton pn count-rates in four XMM-Newton Science Analysis System (SAS) bands (band 2: 0.5 - 2 keV, band 3: 2 - 4.5 keV, band 4: 4.5 - 7.5 keV, band 5: 7.5 - 12 keV); (ii) spectral photon indices in the 0.5 - 4.5 keV band, the 2 - 10 keV band and the 0.5 - 10 keV band; (iii) fluxes in the soft (0.5 - 2 keV), hard (2 - 10 keV), XID (0.5 - 4.5 keV), ultra-hard (4.5 - 7.5 keV) and &amp;amp;quot;total&amp;amp;quot; (0.5 - 10 keV) bands; and (iv) flags describing to which of the samples discussed in the paper (soft, hard, XID or ultra-hard) each source belongs.

Of these sources, 75 are in the bulge and 71 are in the ring. The authors report photometric properties of these sources in a point-source catalog. There are ~ 40% of the bulge sources and ~ 25% of the ring sources showing &amp;amp;gt; 3-sigma long-term variability in their X-ray count rate. The X-ray colors suggest that a significant fraction of the bulge (~ 75%) and ring (~ 65%) sources are likely low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). The spectra of the nuclear source indicate that it is a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN) with moderate obscuration; spectral variability is observed between individual observations. The authors construct 0.3-8.0 keV X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) for the bulge and ring XRB populations, taking into account the detection incompleteness and background AGN contamination. They reach 90% completeness limits of ~ 1.5 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;37&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; and ~ 2.2 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;37&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; for the bulge and ring populations, respectively.

In the paper, the authors perform detailed population synthesis modeling of the XRB populations in NGC 1291, which suggests that the observed combined XLF is dominated by an old LMXB population. They compare the bulge and ring XRB populations, and argue that the ring XRBs are associated with a younger stellar population than the bulge sources, based on the relative overdensity of X-ray sources in the ring, the generally harder X-ray color of the ring sources, the overabundance of luminous sources in the combined XLF, and the flatter shape of the ring XLF.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=ngc1291cxo&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/ngc1291cxo.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The main objective of this study is to identify the active galactic nuclei (AGN) in this field. Wide-field VLBI observations were made of all known radio sources in the COSMOS field at 1.4 GHz using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). The authors also collected complementary multiwavelength information from the literature for the VLBA-detected sources.The combination of the number of sources, sensitivity, angular resolution and the area covered by this project are unprecedented. A catalog which contains the VLBI-detected sources is presented, the main purpose of which is to be used as an AGN catalog. the complementary multiwavelength (optical, infrared and X-ray) information of the VLBI-detected sources is also presented. The authors have detected 468 radio sources, expected to be AGN, with the VLBA. This is, to date, the largest sample assembled of VLBI-detected sources in the sub-mJy regime. They find a detection fraction of 20% +/- 1%, considering only those sources from the input catalog which were in principle detectable with the VLBA (2,361). As a function of the VLA flux density, the detection fraction is higher for higher flux densities, since at high flux densities a source could be detected even if the VLBI core accounts for a small percentage of the total flux density. As a function of redshift, the authors see no evolution of the detection fraction over the redshift range 0.5 &amp;amp;lt; z &amp;amp;lt; 3. In addition, they find that faint radio sources typically have a greater fraction of their radio luminosity in a compact core: ~70% of the sub-mJy sources detected with the VLBA have more than half of their total radio luminosity in a VLBI-scale component, whereas this is true for only ~30% of the sources that are brighter than 10 mJy. This suggests that fainter radio sources differ intrinsically from brighter ones. Across the entire sample, the authors find the predominant morphological classification of the host galaxies of the VLBA-detected sources to be early type (57%), although this varies with redshift and at z &amp;amp;gt; 1.5 they find that spiral galaxies become the most prevalent (48%). The number of detections is high enough to study the faint radio population with statistically significant numbers.

The availability of a large training set of spectroscopic redshifts that extends to faint magnitudes enabled photometric redshifts comparable to the highest quality results presently available for normal galaxies. The authors demonstrate that morphologically extended, faint X-ray sources without optical variability are more accurately described by a library of normal galaxies (corrected for emission lines) than by active galactic nucleus (AGN) dominated templates, even if these sources have AGNlike X-ray luminosities. Preselecting the library on the bases of the source properties allowed them to reach an accuracy sigma[Delta-z/(1+Z&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;spec&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;)] ~ 0.015 with a fraction of outliers of 5.8% for the entire Chandra-COSMOS sample.

These considerations should be kept in mind when defining the observational strategies of upcoming large surveys targeting AGNs, such as eROSITA at X-ray energies and the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder Evolutionary Map of the Universe in the radio band.

A total of 784 radio components are identified (see the companion table ATLASCSCPT), corresponding to 726 distinct radio sources, nearly all of which are identified with SWIRE sources. Of the radio sources with measured redshifts, most lie in the redshift range 0.5 to 2 and include both star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei. The authors identify a rare population of infrared-faint radio sources that are bright at radio wavelengths but are not seen in the available optical, infrared, or X-ray data. Such rare classes of sources can only be discovered in wide, deep surveys such as this. The radio observations where made on 2002 Apr 4-27, Aug 24-29 and 2004 Jan 7-12, Feb 1-5, Jun 6-12 and Nov 24-30, with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). The observations in 2002 were made in a mosaic of 7 overlapping fields, for a total of 149 hours of integration time, or 21.3 hours per pointing. The observations in 2004 were taken in the AT mosaic mode, in which the array was cycled around 21 pointing centers They total 173 hours of integration time, or 8.2 hours per pointing. All observations were made with two 128-MHz bands, centered on frequencies of 1344 and 1472 MHz. This table contains the list of 726 radio sources and their cross-identifications at optical and infrared wavelengths which were given in Table 6 of the reference paper. The authors define a radio &apos;component&apos; as a region of radio emission identified in the source extraction process. They define a radio &apos;source&apos; as one or more radio components that appear to be physically connected and that probably correspond to one galaxy. Thus, the authors count a classical triple radio-loud source as being a radio source consisting of three radio components, but count a pair of interacting starburst galaxies as being two sources, each with one radio component.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=atlascsid&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/atlascsid.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

In Table 3 of the reference paper (available at the HEASARC as the linked table SWXCSOXID), when possible, optical counterparts are given for these candidates. The authors consider the fields with Galactic latitude |b| &amp;amp;gt; 20 degrees so as to avoid regions of high H I column density.

A total of 6760 of these sources have hard X-ray colors, and the majority of them lie near the Galactic center, while most of the remaining 2257 soft X-ray sources lie in the foreground. The authors have cross-correlated the X-ray source positions with the 2MASS and SIRIUS near-infrared catalogs, which collectively contain stars with a 10-sigma limiting flux of K&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;s&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;= 15.6 mag. In order to distinguish absorbed infrared sources near the Galactic center from those in the foreground, they defined red and blue sources as those which have H - K&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;s&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt;= 0.9 and &amp;amp;lt; 0.9 mag, respectively. The authors find that 5.8% =/- 1.5% (2 sigma) of the hard X-ray sources have real infrared counterparts, of which 228 +/- 99 are red and 166 +/- 27 are blue. The red counterparts are probably comprised of Wolf-Rayet and O stars, high-mass X-ray binaries, and symbiotic binaries located near the Galactic center. Foreground X-ray binaries suffering intrinsic X-ray absorption could be included in the sample of blue infrared counterparts to hard X-ray sources. The authors also find that 39.4% +/- 1.0% of the soft X-ray sources have blue infrared counterparts; most of these are probably coronally active dwarfs in the foreground. There is a noteworthy collection of ~20 red counterparts to hard X-ray sources near the Sagittarius B H II region, which are probably massive binaries that have formed within the last several Myr. For each of the infrared matches to X-ray sources in their catalog, the authors derived the probability that the association is real, based on the source properties and the results of the cross-correlation analysis.

The positions of 60% of the sources are accurate to &amp;amp;lt;1 arcsecond (95% confidence), and 20% have positions accurate to &amp;amp;lt;0.5 arcsec. The authors search for variable sources, and find that 3% exhibit flux variations within an observation, and 10% exhibit variations from observation-to-observation. They also find one source, CXOUGC J174622.7-285218, with a periodic 1745 s signal (1.4% chance probability), which is probably a magnetically accreting cataclysmic variable. The authors compare the spatial distribution of X-ray sources to a model for the stellar distribution, and find 2.8 sigma evidence for excesses in the numbers of X-ray sources in the region of recent star formation encompassed by the Arches, Quintuplet, and Galactic center star clusters. These excess sources are also seen in the luminosity distribution of the X-ray sources, which is flatter near the Arches and Quintuplet than elsewhere in the field. These excess point sources, along with a similar longitudinal asymmetry in the distribution of diffuse iron emission that has been reported by other authors, probably have their origin in the young stars that are prominent at a galactic lonitude ~ 0.1 degrees. This tables was designed to be inclusive, so sources of questionable quality are included, according to the authors. For instance, 134 sources have net numbers of counts in the 0.5-8.0 keV band that are consistent with 0 at the 90% confidence level. These sources are only detected in a single band and are presumably either very hard or very soft, detected in single observations because they were transients, or detected in stacked observations with wvdecomp at marginal significance. The authors have chosen to include them because they passed the test based on Poisson statistics from Weisskopf et al. (2007, ApJ, 657, 1026).

In this respect, the IC 1805 open cluster is very interesting as it hosts the O4 If+ star HD 15570 that is thought to be in an evolutionary stage intermediate between a normal O-star and a Wolf-Rayet star. Such a star could provide a test for theoretical models aiming at explaining the empirical scaling relation between the X-ray and bolometric luminosities of O-type stars. The authors have observed IC 1805 with XMM-Newton and further collected optical spectroscopy of some of the O-star members of the cluster. The optical spectra allowed them to revisit the orbital solutions of BD +60 497 and HD 15558, and provided the first evidence of binarity for BD +60 498. X-ray emission from colliding winds does not appear to play an important role among the O-stars of IC 1805. Notably, the X-ray fluxes do not vary significantly between archival X-ray observations and the present XMM-Newton pointing. The very fast rotator BD +60 513, and to a lesser extent the O4 If+ star HD 15570, appear somewhat underluminous. While the underluminosity of HD 15570 is only marginally significant, its amplitude is found to be compatible with theoretical expectations based on its stellar and wind properties.

This survey will map out the locations of the extragalactic radio sources relative to the large scale structure as traced by the X-ray emission. This is of particular interest because radio galaxies and radio-loud AGN show strong and complex interactions with their small and larger scale environment, and different classes of radio galaxies are suggested to lie at different places with respect to the large scale structure. For the phase calibration of the radio data, the authors used standard self-calibration at 325 MHz and field-base calibration at 74 MHz. Polyhedron-based imaging as well as mosaicking methods were used at both frequencies. At 74 MHz, the resolution was 30 arcseconds, the median 5-sigma sensitivity was ~ 162 mJy/beam and 666 sources were detected over an area of 132 square degrees. At 325 MHz, the resolution was 6.7 arcseconds, the median 5-sigma sensitivity was 4 mJy/beam, and 847 sources were detected over an area of 15.3 square degrees. At 325 MHz, a region of diffuse radio emission which is a cluster halo or relic candidate was detected. The observations were conducted using the VLA in July 2003 in the A-configuration (most extended) and in June 2002 in the B-configuration. This table contains the VLA 74-MHz source list, comprising 617 single sources and 108 components of 51 multiple sources, for a total of 725 entries.

The catalog of detected sources includes 132 objects. The statistical sample detected on the time-averaged 100-150 keV map at a significance above 5 sigma contains 88 sources: 28 active galactic nuclei (AGNs), 38 low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), 10 high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) and 12 rotation-powered young X-ray pulsars. The catalog also includes 15 persistent sources, which were registered at a significance 4 sigma &amp;amp;lt;= S/N &amp;amp;lt; 5 sigma, where S/N is the signal-to-noise ratio, but at the same time were firmly detected (&amp;amp;gt;= 12 sigma) in the lower 17-60 keV energy band. All registered sources are known X-ray emitters, which means that the catalog has 100% purity in this respect. Additionally, 29 catalogued sources were detected significantly in different time slices of the survey. In the reference paper presenting the results of this survey, the authors present a hardness ratio for Galactic and extragalactic sources, an LMXB longitudinal asymmetry, and a number-flux relation for non-blazar AGNs. At higher energies, in the 150-300 keV energy band, 25 sources have been detected with S/N &amp;amp;gt;= 5 sigma, including seven AGNs, 13 LMXBs, three HMXBs and two rotation-powered pulsars. Among LMXBs and HMXBs, the authors identified 12 black hole candidates (BHCs) and four neutron star (NS) binaries. For this hard X-ray survey, the authors utilized all publicly available INTEGRAL data acquired by the IBIS telescope between 2002 December and 2014 January (INTEGRAL spacecraft revolutions 26 - 1377). The survey also contains private data from the M82 deep field (PI: Sazonov) and scanning observations of the Galactic Center (PI: Krivonos) and Puppis region (PI: Tsygankov). The survey sky coverage as a function of a 5-sigma limiting flux is shown in Fig. 2 of the reference paper.

The catalog has been compiled from sources passed through detection conditions in the reference 100-150 keV energy band on time-average sky maps (Section 2.1 of the reference paper) and maps built over different time periods (Section 2.2 ibid.). For all 132 sources, the time-averaged fluxes are given, even for those sources which were not detected therein. For some variable sources and for sources which were only detected in certain time periods, the fluxes measured in the specified time intervals are also given.

This catalog has 157 sources with flux densities spanning two orders of magnitude from 15 to 1500 mJy. Comparison to other catalogs shows that 98% of the ACT detections correspond to sources detected at lower radio frequencies. Three of the sources appear to be associated with the brightest cluster galaxies of low redshift X-ray selected galaxy clusters. Estimates of the radio to mm-wave spectral indices and differential counts of the sources further bolster the hypothesis that they are nearly all radio sources, and that their emission is not dominated by re-emission from warm dust. In a bright (&amp;amp;gt;50 mJy) 148 GHz-selected sample with complete cross-identifications from the Australia Telescope 20-GHz survey, the authors of the study observe an average steepening of the spectra between 5, 20, and 148 GHz with median spectral indices of alpha&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;5-20&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; = -0.07 +/- 0.06, alpha&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;20-148&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; = -0.39 +/- 0.04, and alpha&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;5-148&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; = -0.20 +/- 0.03.

The authors find a total of 84 compact sources on the ACIS-S3 chip, of which 66 are located within the 25.0 B-mag/arcsec&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; isophote of the galactic disk of NGC 1068. In the reference paper, the spectra of the 21 X-ray sources with at least 50 counts were modeled with both multicolor disk blackbody and power-law models. The power-law model provides the better description of the spectrum for 18 of these sources. For fainter sources, the spectral index was estimated from the hardness ratio. Five sources have 0.4-8 keV intrinsic luminosities greater than 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;39&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; ergs s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, assuming that their emission is isotropic and that they are associated with NGC 1068. The authors refer to these sources as intermediate-luminosity X-ray objects (IXOs). If these five sources are X-ray binaries accreting with luminosities that are both sub-Eddington and isotropic, then the implied source masses are &amp;amp;gt;~7 solar masses, and so they are inferred to be black holes. Most of the spectrally modeled sources have spectral shapes similar to Galactic black hole candidates. However, the brightest compact source in NGC 1068 has a spectrum that is much harder than that found in Galactic black hole candidates and other IXOs. The brightest source also shows large amplitude variability on both short-term and long-term timescales, with the count rate possibly decreasing by a factor of 2 in ~2 ks during this Chandra observation, and the source flux decreasing by a factor of 5 between this observation and the grating observations taken just over 9 months later. The ratio of the number of sources with luminosities greater than 2.1 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;38&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; ergs s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; in the 0.4-8 keV band to the rate of massive (&amp;amp;gt;5 solar masses) star formation is the same, to within a factor of 2, for NGC 1068, the Antennae, NGC 5194 (the main galaxy in M51), and the Circinus galaxy. This suggests that the rate of production of X-ray binaries per massive star is approximately the same for galaxies with currently active star formation, including &amp;amp;quot;starbursts.&amp;amp;quot; The authors were concerned with the study of the discrete X-ray source population in NGC 1068, imaged within the 8.4 arcmin x 8.4 arcmin (35.3 kpc x 35.3 kpc) field of view of the ACIS S3 chip. Images were extracted from the reprocessed level 2 events file in soft (0.4-1.5 keV), hard (1.5-5.0 keV) and full (0.4-5.0 keV) energy bands. The authors used the CIAO program wavdetect to search the images in the three energy bands for discrete sources of X-ray emission. They analyzed the images using wavelet scales in the range from 1 pixel (0.492 arcsec) to 16 pixels (7.87 arcsec), separated by a factor of sqrt(2). The wavelet source detection threshold was set to 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-6&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, which gives approximately one false source for the whole S3 chip. The total number of sources detected by wavdetect in the soft, hard, and full energy band images was 115, 67, and 138, respectively. Each of these sources was examined carefully by eye, and only those 84 sources that appear compact to the eye are included in this source list.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=ngc1068cxo&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/ngc1068cxo.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) was completed in 2003 and its final data products, including an extended source catalog (XSC), are available online. The 2MASS XSC contains nearly a million galaxies with K&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;s&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;= 13.5 mag and is essentially complete and mostly unaffected by interstellar extinction and stellar confusion down to a galactic latitude of |b| = 5 degrees for bright galaxies. Near-infrared wavelengths are sensitive to the old stellar populations that dominate galaxy masses, making 2MASS an excellent starting point to study the distribution of matter in the nearby universe. The authors selected a sample of 44,599 2MASS galaxies with K&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;s&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;= 11.75 mag and |b| &amp;amp;gt;= 5 degrees (&amp;amp;gt;= 8 degrees toward the Galactic bulge) as the input catalog for their survey. They obtained spectroscopic observations for 11,000 galaxies and used previously obtained velocities for the remainder of the sample to generate a redshift catalog that is 97.6% complete to well-defined limits and covers 91% of the sky. This provides an unprecedented census of galaxy (baryonic mass) concentrations within 300 Mpc. Earlier versions of their survey have been used in a number of publications that have studied the bulk motion of the Local Group, mapped the density and peculiar velocity fields out to 50 h&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; Mpc, detected galaxy groups, and estimated the values of several cosmological parameters.

Additionally, they flagged 314 bona fide galaxies with compromised photometry for reprocessing at a future date. Some of these galaxies have bright stars very close to their nuclei which were not detected by the pipeline. Others are in regions of high stellar density and their center positions and/or isophotal radii have been incorrectly measured by the pipeline. Lastly, some are close pairs or multiples but the pipeline only identified a single object. A detailed explanation of the steps taken to reject and reprocess the flagged galaxies is given in the Appendix of the reference paper.

They constructed distributions of orbital binaries of the dynamical mass, period, semi-major axis, and eccentricity of systems, which characterize the set. Some problems related to the parametrization of orbital binaries are also discussed in the paper. To compile the orbit list, the authors combined data from both OARMAC and ORB6. At this stage, they maintained systems without parallaxes, but removed systems without a period or semi-major axis. The resulting list contained 3139 orbits for 2278 pairs: 1588 pairs have a single orbit, 548 pairs have two orbits, 120 pairs have three orbits, 19 pairs have four orbits, one pair has five orbits, and two pairs have seven orbits.

The preferential detection in X-rays of low-mass PMS stars gives strong indications of their membership. The authors study X-ray activity as a function of stellar and circumstellar characteristics by correlating the X-ray luminosities, temperatures, and absorptions with optical and near-infrared (NIR) data from the literature. The authors detected 420 X-ray point sources in the observation above a 4.6-sigma significance threshold using the PWDetect software. Optical and NIR counterparts were found in the literature for 85% of the sources. The authors argue that more than 90% of these counterparts are NGC 2264 members, thereby significantly increasing the known low-mass cluster population by about 100 objects. Among the sources without counterpart, about 50% are probably associated with members, several of which are expected to be previously unknown protostellar objects. With regard to activity, several previous findings are confirmed: X-ray luminosity is related to stellar mass, although with a large scatter; L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;x&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;/L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;bol&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; is close to, but almost invariably below, the saturation level of 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-3&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, especially when considering the quiescent X-ray emission. A comparison between classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) and weak-line T Tauri stars (WTTS) shows several differences: CTTS have, at any given mass, activity levels that are both lower and more scattered than WTTS; emission from CTTS may also be more time variable and is on average slightly harder than for WTTS. However, there is evidence in some CTTS of extremely cool, ~0.1 - 0.2 keV, plasma which the authors speculate is due to plasma heated by accretion shocks. The X-ray spectra of the 199 sources with more than 50 detected photons were analyzed by the authors. Spectral fits were performed with XSPEC 11.3 and with several shell and TCL scripts to automate the process. For each source, they fit the data in the [0.5 - 7.0] keV energy interval with several model spectra: one and two isothermal components (APEC), subject to photoelectric absorption from interstellar and circumstellar material (WABS). Plasma abundances for one-temperature (1T) models were fixed at 0.3 times the solar abundances, while they were both fixed at that value and treated as a free parameter for the two-temperature (2T) models. The absorbing column densities, N&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;H&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;, were both left as a free parameter and fixed at values corresponding to the optically/NIR determined extinctions, when available: N&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;H&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; = 1.6 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;21&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; A&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;V&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;.

The main goal of the present paper was to study the X-ray source populations of M31. An X-ray catalog of 1897 sources was created (&apos;the XMM LP-total catalog&apos;), with 914 sources detected for the first time. Source classification and identification were based on X-ray hardness ratios, spatial extents of the sources, and cross correlation with catalogs in the X-ray, optical, infrared and radio wavelengths. The authors also analysed the long-term variability of the X-ray sources and this variability allowed them to distinguish between X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei (AGN). Furthermore, supernova remnant classifications of previous studies that did not use long-term variability as a classification criterion could be validated. Including previous Chandra and ROSAT observations in the long-term variability study allowed the authors to detect additional transient or at least highly variable sources, which are good candidate X-ray binaries. Fourteen of the 30 supersoft source (SSS) candidates represent supersoft emission of optical novae.

This connection between SNRs and star-forming regions implies that most of the remnants originate in type II supernovae. The brightest sources in X-rays in M 31 belong to the class of X-ray binaries (XRBs). Ten low-mass XRBs (LMXBs) and 26 LMXB candidates were identified based on their temporal variability. In addition, 36 LMXBs and 17 LMXB candidates were identified owing to correlations with globular clusters and globular cluster candidates. From optical and X-ray colour-colour diagrams, possible high-mass XRB (HMXB) candidates were selected. Two of these candidates have an X-ray spectrum as expected for an HMXB containing a neutron star primary. While this survey has greatly improved our understanding of the X-ray source populations in M 31, at this point 65% of the sources can still only be classified as &amp;amp;quot;hard&amp;amp;quot; sources; i.e. it is not possible to decide whether these sources are X-ray binaries or Crab-like supernova remnants in M 31 or X-ray sources in the background. Deeper observations in X-ray and at other wavelengths would help to classify these sources.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=m31deepxmm&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/m31deepxmm.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

In their paper, the authors provide catalogs of QSO properties, and describe their novel method of calculating X-ray flux upper limits and effective sky coverage. Spectroscopic redshifts are available for about 1/3 of the detected sample; elsewhere, redshifts are estimated photometrically. The authors have detected 56 QSOs with redshift z &amp;amp;gt; 3, substantially expanding the known sample. They find no evidence for evolution out to z ~ 5 for either the X-ray photon index Gamma or for the ratio of optical/UV to X-ray flux Alpha_ox. About 10% of detected QSOs show best-fit intrinsic absorbing columns greater than 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;22&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, but the fraction might reach ~1/3 if most nondetections are absorbed. The authors confirm a significant correlation between Alpha_ox and optical luminosity, but it flattens or disappears for fainter (M_B &amp;amp;gt;~ -23) active galactic nucleus (AGN) alone. They report significant hardening of Gamma both toward higher X-ray luminosity, and for relatively X-ray loud quasars. These trends may represent a relative increase in nonthermal X-ray emission, and their findings thereby strengthen analogies between Galactic black hole binaries and AGN. For uniformly selected subsamples of narrow-line Seyfert 1s and narrow absorption line QSOs, they find no evidence for unusual distributions of either Alpha_ox or Gamma.

They have detected a total of 478 sources, 395 and 205 of which detected in the S and H bands respectively. They identified 7 clearly extended sources and estimated their redshift through X-ray spectral fits with thermal models. In four cases the redshift is consistent with z = 0.4, so they may have detected a large scale structure formed by groups and clusters of galaxies through their hot intra-cluster gas emission. The relative density of the S band sources is higher near the clusters and groups at z ~ 0.4 and extends toward East and the South/West. This suggests that the structure is complex, with a size comparable to the full XMM-Newton field.

The authors analyzed a 97.7ks Chandra ACIS-I observation pointed at the core of the Cygnus OB2 region. Sources were detected using the PWDETECT code and were positionally correlated with optical and near-IR catalogs from the literature. Source events were extracted with the ACIS EXTRACT package. X-ray variability was characterized through the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and spectra were fitted using absorbed APEC thermal plasma models. The authors detected 1003 X-ray sources. Of these, 775 have near-IR counterparts and are expected to be almost all associated with Cygnus OB2 members. From near-IR color-color and color-magnitude diagrams, they estimate a typical absorption toward Cygnus OB2 of A&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;V&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ 7.0 mag. Although the region is young, very few stars (~ 4.4%) show disk-induced excesses in the near-IR. X-ray variability is detected in ~ 13% of the sources, but this fraction increases, up to 50%, with increasing source statistics. Flares account for at least 60% of the variability. Despite being generally bright, all but 2 of the 26 detected O-type and early B-type stars are not significantly variable. Typical X-ray spectral parameters are log N&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;H&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ 22.25 (cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;) and kT ~ 1.35 keV with 1-sigma dispersion of 0.2 dex and 0.4 keV, respectively. Variable and flaring sources have harder spectra with median kT = 3.3 and 3.8 keV, respectively. OB stars are typically softer (kT ~ 0.75 keV). X-ray luminosities range between 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;30&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; and 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;31&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; for intermediate-mass and low-mass stars, and between 2.5 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;30&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; and 6.3 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;33&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; for OB stars. Cygnus OB2 was observed with the ACIS detector on board the Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO) on 2004 January 16 (Obs.Id. 4511; PI: E. Flaccomio). The ACIS-I 17&apos; x 17&apos; field of view is covered by 4 chips each with 1024 x 1024 pixels (scale 0.49 arcseconds per pixel).

The 2XMM Catalog and the associated time-series (&apos;light-curve&apos;) data products have been used as the basis for the survey of X-ray flares from cool stars in the Hipparcos Tycho-2 catalog. In addition, the authors have generated and analyzed spectrally-resolved (i.e. hardness-ratio) X-ray light-curves. Where available, they have compared XMM OM UV/optical data with the X-ray light-curves. Their sample contains ~130 flares with well-observed profiles; they originate from ~70 stars.

Most of the ~30 serendipitously-observed (target_flag = &apos;N&apos;) stars have little previously reported information. The hardness-ratio plots clearly illustrate the spectral (and hence inferred temperature) variations characteristic of many flares, and provide an easily accessible overview of the data. In the reference paper, the authors present flare frequency distributions from both target and serendipitous observations. The latter provide an unbiased (with respect to stellar activity) study of flare energetics; in addition, they allow the authors to predict the numbers of stellar flares that may be detected in future X-ray wide-field surveys. The serendipitous sample demonstrates the need for care when calculating flaring rates, especially when normalizing the number of flares to a total exposure time, where it is important to consider both the stars seen to flare and those from which variability was not detected (i.e., measured as non-variable), since in the present survey, the latter outnumber the former by more than a factor of ten.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=xmmt2flare&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/xmmt2flare.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

In their study, the authors aimed to determine the ensemble variability properties of two serendipitously selected AGN samples extracted from the catalogs of XMM-Newton and Swift (the latter is not included in this table, notice), with redshift between ~ 0.2 and ~ 4.5, and X-ray luminosities, in the 0.5 - 4.5 keV band, between ~ 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;43&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg/s and ~ 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;46&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg/s. They used the structure function (SF), which operates in the time domain, and allows for an ensemble analysis even when only a few observations are available for individual sources and the power spectral density (PSD) cannot be derived. The SF is also more appropriate than fractional variability and excess variance, because these parameters are biased by the duration of the monitoring time interval in the rest-frame, and therefore by cosmological time dilation. The authors find statistically consistent results for the two samples, with the SF described by a power law of the time lag tau, approximately as SF ~ tau&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;0.1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;. They do not find evidence of the break in the SF, at variance with the case of lower luminosity AGNs. They confirm a strong anti-correlation of the variability with X-ray luminosity, accompanied by a change of the slope of the SF. They also find evidence in support of a weak, intrinsic, average increase of X-ray variability with redshift. For XMM, the authors used the version of the Serendipitous Source Catalog then available, namely 2XMMi-DR3, the latest incremental update of the second version of the catalogue, with observations made between 2000 February 3 and 2008 October 08; all datasets were publicly available by 2009 October 31, but not all public observations are included in this catalog. The total area of the catalog fields is ~ 814 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, but taking account of the substantial overlaps between observations, the net sky area covered independently is ~ 504 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;. The 2XMMi-DR3 catalogue contains 353,191 detections (above the processing likelihood threshold of 6), related to 262,902 unique X-ray sources, therefore a significant number of sources (41,979) have more than one record within the catalog. The selected sources were cross-correlated with the DR7 edition of the SDSS Quasar Catalog (Schneider et al. 2010, AJ, 139, 2360) to obtain redshifts and spectral classifications for the sources. The authors used a maximum distance of 1.5 arcseconds, corresponding to the uncertainty in the X-ray positions, resulting in 412 quasars that were observed by XMM-Newton from 2 to 25 epochs each for a total of 1376 observations. The authors refer to these sources as the XMM-Newton sample.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=xmmvaragn&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/xmmvaragn.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

Flux densities span 14 -1700 mJy, and the authors use source spectral indices derived using ACT-only data to divide their sources into two subpopulations: 167 radio galaxies powered by central active galactic nuclei (AGN) and 24 dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). They cross-identify 97% of their sources (166 of the AGN and 19 of the DSFGs) with those in currently available catalogs. When combined with flux densities from the Australia Telescope 20-GHz survey and follow-up observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array, the synchrotron-dominated population is seen to exhibit a steepening of the slope of the spectral energy distribution from 20 to 148 GHz, with the trend continuing to 218 GHz. The ACT dust-dominated source population has a median spectral index, alpha&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;148-218GHz&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;, of 3.7&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;+0.62&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;-0.86&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;, and includes both local galaxies and sources with redshift around 6. Dusty sources with no counterpart in existing catalogs likely belong to a recently discovered subpopulation of DSFGs lensed by foreground galaxies or galaxy groups. The ACT experiment (Swetz et al., 2011, ApJS, 194, 41) is situated on the slopes of Cerro Toco in the Atacama Desert of Chile at an elevation of 5190m. ACT&apos;s latitude gives access to both the northern and southern celestial hemispheres. Observations occurred simultaneously in three frequency bands, at 148 GHz (2.0 mm), 218 GHz (1.4 mm) and 277 GHz (1.1 mm) with angular resolutions of roughly 1.4, 1.0 and 0.9 arcminutes, respectively. The ACT-detected source list contains 169 sources selected at 148 GHz with S/N &amp;amp;gt; 5, spanning two decades in flux density, from 14 to 1700 mJy.

The authors have observed with the ATCA a total of 482 sources in the frequency range between 4.5 and 40 GHz in the period between 2009 July and 2010 August. Several sources were observed more than once. In their paper, the authors present the aims of the project, the selection criteria, and the observation and data reduction procedures. They also discuss the data in total intensity for a complete sample of 189 sources with 20-GHz flux densities &amp;amp;gt; 500 mJy, Galactic latitude |b| &amp;amp;gt; 5 degrees and Declination &amp;amp;lt; -30 degrees, and some statistical analysis of the spectral behavior and variability of this sample, referred to as the &apos;bright PACO sample&apos;. Finally, the authors discuss how these data could be used to transfer absolute calibrations to ground-based telescopes using the cosmic microwave background dipole calibrated flux densities measured by the Planck satellite, and they provide some test fluxes on bright calibrators. This table contains the catalog of 1004 observations of 180 of the 189 sources that comprise the &apos;bright PACO sample&apos;. Thus, each row in this table corresponds to a specific observation of a source, and there can be several rows for any source, corresponding to different observations. The ATCA observations were made in 6 2-GHz wide observing bands: 4732 - 6780 MHz, 8232 - 10280 MHz, 17232 - 19280 MHz, 23232 - 25280 MHz, 32232 - 34280 MHz and 38232 - 40280 MHz. In order to properly define the detailed source spectral behavior, the authors have split each 2-GHz band into 4 x 512 MHz sub-bands, and calibrated each sub-band independently. Thus, for each observation, the flux density at 24 frequencies is given. The frequency identifier in the flux density appears (at least to this HEASARC scientist) to be the lower frequency of the sub-band rather than its central frequency. In order to provide the easiest way to extrapolate the observed counts or model predictions from one frequency to another, the authors have modeled the observed source spectra. As their observations covered a wide frequency range from 4.5 to 40 GHz over which a single power law is not enough to describe the spectral behavior of the sources, they studied the spectra of the 174 point-like sources in this sample by fitting the observed data with a double power law of the form S&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;nu&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; = S&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;0&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;/[(nu/nu&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;0&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;)&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-a&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; + (nu/nu&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;0&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;)&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-b&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;], where nu is the frequency, S&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;nu&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; is the flux density in Jy, and S&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;0&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;, nu&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;0&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;, a and b are free parameters.

The survey was intended to serve as a low-frequency counterpart to the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO)-VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) at 1400 MHz, allowing spectral information to be compiled for statistical samples of sources. It also provides a low-frequency sky model. In their 2012 and 2014 reference papers, the authors present the details of improvements to data processing and analysis which were used for a re-reduction of the VLSS data, which they dub the VLSS redux or VLSSr. They used the VLSS catalogue as a sky model to correct the ionospheric distortions in the data and create a new set of sky maps and corresponding catalog at 73.8 MHz. The VLSS Redux (VLSSr) has a resolution of 75&amp;amp;quot;, and an average map rms noise level of sigma ~ 0.1 Jy beam&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;. The clean bias is 0.66 x sigma and the theoretical largest angular size is 36 arcminutes. Six previously unimaged fields are included in the VLSSr, which has an unbroken sky coverage over 9.3 steradian above an irregular southern boundary. The final catalog includes 92,965 sources (in the abstract of Lane et al. (2014) it states 92.964 sources). The VLSSr improves upon the original VLSS in a number of areas including imaging of large sources, image sensitivity, and clean bias; however the most critical improvement is the replacement of an inaccurate primary beam correction which caused source flux errors which vary as a function of radius to the nearest pointing center in the VLSS.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=vlssr&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/vlssr.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The number of 44 SNRs and candidates more than doubles the X-ray-detected SNRs. 22 sources are new SNR candidates in M 31 based on X-ray selection criteria. Another SNR candidate might be the first plerion detected outside the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds. On the other hand, six sources are foreground stars and 90 are foreground star candidates, one is a BL Lac-type active galactic nucleus (AGN) and 36 are AGN candidates, one source coincides with the Local Group galaxy M 32, one with a background galaxy cluster (GCl) and another is a GCl candidate, all sources which are not connected with M31. In a second paper, the authors presented an extension to the original 2005 XMM-Newton X-ray source catalog of M 31 which contained 39 newly found sources. These sources have been added to the original 856 sources to make a combined catalog of 895 X-ray sources which is contained herein.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=m31xmmxray&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/m31xmmxray.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The survey (hereafter referred to as the ATCA-ADFS survey) has 1-sigma detection limits ranging from 18.7 to 50 microJansky per beam (uJy/beam, over an area of ~1.1 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, and ~2.5 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; to lower sensitivity. The observations, data reduction and source count analysis are presented in the paper, along with a description of the overall scientific objectives, and a catalog containing 530 radio sources detected with a resolution of 6.2 x 4.9 arcseconds (contained herein). The AKARI Deep Field South survey was primarily made in the far-infrared at wavelengths of 65, 90, 140, 160 micron (um) over a 12 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; area with the AKARI Far-Infrared Surveyor (FIS) instrument, with shallower mid-infrared coverage at 9 and 18 um using the AKARI Infrared Camera (IRC) instrument. In addition to the wide survey, deeper mid-infrared pointed observations, using the IRC, covering ~0.8 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; and reaching 5-sigma sensitivities of 16, 16, 74, 132, 280 and 580 uJy at 3.2, 4.6, 7, 11, 15 and 24 um, respectively, were also carried out. The radio observations were collected over a 13 day period in 2007 July using the ATCA operated at 1.344 and 1.432 GHz. The total integration time for the 2007 observations was 120 hours. The 2007 data were augmented with a further deep observation made in 2008 December over five nights towards a single pointing position at the ADF-S, which lay just off center of the larger ATCA-ADFS field reported here. This added a further 50 h of integration time. The data were processed in exactly the same way as that from the 2007 observing sessions. Note that in the terminology of the authors, a radio component is described as a region of radio emission represented by a Gaussian shaped object in the map. Close radio doubles are represented by two Gaussians and are deemed to consist of two components, which make up a single source. A selection of radio sources with multiple components is shown in Fig. 3 of the reference paper.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=atcaadfs20&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/atcaadfs20.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

This data in part results from the merging of the data resulting from a joint project between K. Janes, C. Duke and Lynga, herein refered to as JDL data. The aim of that project was to discuss properties of the open cluster system by using existing data and by taking their accuracy into proper regard. Thus the data were assessed, mostly by Janes, weight assigned and weighted mean values derived of reddenings, turn-off colors and distances.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=lyngaclust&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/lyngaclust.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

From this rich data set, the authors have created a catalog of the 110 sources from the S3 chip which were detected with a significance of greater than 3-sigma. This detection threshold corresponds to a flux of ~ 10^-16 ergs/cm^2/s and a luminosity of ~ 10^36 ergs/s for a distance to M 101 of 7.2 Mpc. The sources display a distinct correlation with the spiral arms of M101 and include a variety of X-ray binaries, supersoft sources, supernova remnants, and other objects of which only ~27 are likely to be background sources. The 29 brightest sources have enough flux (greater than 100 counts) to perform at least crude spectral modeling using the HEASARC XSPEC model fitting program. Most of the sources could be satisfactorily fitted with a simple absorbed power-law spectrum model; however, eight of the softest sources were better fitted by an absorbed blackbody model.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=m101cxo&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/m101cxo.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The authors have derived the spectral types and estimated distances for all of their stars. The spectral types range between K5 and M6. Nearly half of the stars lie within 50 pc. The authors have measured the equivalent width of the H-alpha emission line. Their targets show an increase in chromospheric activity from early to mid-spectral types, with a peak in activity around M5. Using the count rate and hardness ratios obtained from the ROSAT catalog,the authors have derived the stellar X-ray luminosities. Their stars display a &amp;amp;quot;saturation-type&amp;amp;quot; relation between the chromospheric and coronal activity. The relation is such that log L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;/L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;bol&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; remains &amp;amp;quot;saturated&amp;amp;quot; at a value of approximately -3 for varying H-alpha equivalent width. The authors have found 568 matches in the USNO-B catalog and have derived the tangential velocities v&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;tan&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; for these stars. There is a slight trend of decreasing chromospheric activity with age, such that the stars with higher v&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;tan&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; values have lower H-alpha equivalent widths.

This survey has an unprecedented combination of both spatial resolution (25&amp;amp;quot; FWHM) and sensitivity (1-sigma as low as 24mJy/beam). The authors detect 949 sources at the 5-sigma level in this region, enough to begin exploring the nature of the 74-MHz source population. In their paper, they present differential source counts, spectral index measurements, and the size distribution as determined from counterparts in the high-resolution FIRST 1.4-GHz survey. They find a trend of steeper spectral indices for the brighter sources. Further, there is a clear correlation between spectral index and median source size, with the flat-spectrum sources being much smaller on average. Ultra-steep spectrum objects (power-law index alpha &amp;amp;lt;= -1.2, where S_nu ~ nu&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;alpha&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;) are identified. These sources are excellent candidates for high-redshift radio galaxies. The data used to produce this survey come from observations taken on 1998 March 7 intended to map two normal galaxies at 74 MHz (NGC 4565 and NGC 4631). These two pointings were separated by 6.4 degrees, roughly the radius of the primary beam at 74 MHz, allowing them to be ideally combined to produce a single deep image roughly 17 x 10 degrees in size. The combination of VLA A-configuration resolution (25 arcsec), favorable ionospheric conditions, and pointings in directions near the NGP, where the background temperature is low, produced the deepest observation ever obtained below 100 MHz. The same algorithm that was used in the 1.4-GHz NVSS was used to identify and characterize sources in this 74-MHz survey. The source detection algorithm had a threshold such that sources must have both a peak and integrated flux density level of at least 5 times the local rms noise level. Since the rms noise level varied from 24 mJy/beam to 80 mJy mJy/beam at the chosen field edge, the absolute level of the source-detection threshold of 5-sigma likewise varied over the image.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=vla74mhzdp&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/vla74mhzdp.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

NuSTAR operates in the band from 3 to 79 keV, extending the sensitivity of focusing far beyond the ~10 keV high-energy cutoff achieved by all previous X-ray satellites. The inherently low background associated with concentrating the X-ray light enables NuSTAR to probe the hard X-ray sky with a more than 100-fold improvement in sensitivity over the collimated or coded mask instruments that have operated in this bandpass. Using its unprecedented combination of sensitivity and spatial and spectral resolution, NuSTAR will pursue five primary scientific objectives: (1) probe obscured active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity out to the peak epoch of galaxy assembly in the universe (at z &amp;amp;lt;~ 2) by surveying selected regions of the sky; (2) study the population of hard X-ray-emitting compact objects in the Galaxy by mapping the central regions of the Milky Way; (3) study the non-thermal radiation in young supernova remnants, both the hard X-ray continuum and the emission from the radioactive element &amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;44&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;Ti; (4) observe blazars contemporaneously with ground-based radio, optical, and TeV telescopes, as well as with Fermi and Swift, to constrain the structure of AGN jets; and (5) observe line and continuum emission from core-collapse supernovae in the Local Group, and from nearby Type Ia events, to constrain explosion models. During its baseline two-year mission, NuSTAR will also undertake a broad program of targeted observations. The observatory consists of two co-aligned grazing-incidence X-ray telescopes pointed at celestial targets by a three-axis stabilized spacecraft. Deployed into a 600-km, near-circular, 6&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;o&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; inclination orbit, the observatory is performing consistent with pre-launch expectations.

The authors present a catalog of these variable stars along with their light curves and ancillary data. Variability was detected to a lower limit of 0.02 mag amplitude in the 4000-10000 Angstroms range using the photometrically stable Aspect Camera on board the Chandra spacecraft. The Chandra Variable Guide Star Catalog (VGUIDE) contains 827 stars, of which 586 are classified as definitely variable and 241 are identified as possibly variable. Of the 586 definite variable stars, the authors believe 319 are new variable star identifications. Types of variables in the catalog include eclipsing binaries, pulsating stars, and rotating stars. The variability was detected during the course of normal verification of each Chandra pointing and results from analysis of over 75,000 guide star light curves from the Chandra mission. The VGUIDE catalog represents data from only about 9 years of the Chandra mission. Future releases of VGUIDE will include newly identified variable guide stars as the mission proceeds. An important advantage of the use of space data to identify and analyze variable stars is the relatively long observations that are available. The Chandra orbit allows for observations up to 2 days in length. Also, guide stars were often used multiple times for Chandra observations, so many of the stars in the VGUIDE catalog have multiple light curves available from various times in the mission. The catalog is presented as both online data associated with this paper (from which this HEASARC representation was created) and as a public Web interface at &amp;amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://cxc.harvard.edu/vguide/&quot;&amp;amp;gt;http://cxc.harvard.edu/vguide/&amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;gt;. Light curves with data at the instrumental time resolution of about 2 s, overplotted with the data binned at 1 ks, can be viewed on the above-mentioned public Web interface and downloaded for further analysis. (This HEASARC Browse table also contains links to these light curves). VGUIDE is a unique project using data collected during the mission that would otherwise be ignored. The stars available for use as Chandra guide stars are generally 6-11 magnitudes and are commonly spectral types A and later. Due to the selection of guide stars entirely for positional convenience, this catalog avoids the possible bias of searching for variability in objects where it is to be expected. Statistics of variability compared to spectral type indicate the expected dominance of A-F stars as pulsators. Eclipsing binaries are consistently 20%-30% of the detected var iables across all spectral types.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=chanvguide&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/chanvguide.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

There are B, V, R, I, and z&apos; photometry for 521 (99%) of the 525 sources in the X-ray catalog and spectroscopic redshifts for 271 (52%), including 20 stars. The authors did not find evidence for redshift groupings of the X-ray sources, like those found in the Chandra Deep Field surveys, because of the larger solid angle covered by this survey. They separated the X-ray sources by optical spectral type and examined the colors, apparent and absolute magnitudes, and redshift distributions for the broad-line and non-broad-line active galactic nuclei. Combining their wide-area survey with other Chandra and XMM-Newton hard X-ray surveys, they find a definite lack of luminous, high accretion rate sources at z &amp;amp;lt; 1, consistent with previous observations that showed that super-massive black hole growth is dominated at low redshifts by sources with low accretion rates.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=clasxs&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/clasxs.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

They conclude that although environment undoubtedly affects the X-ray properties of individual galaxies, particularly those in the centres of groups and clusters, it does not change the nature of whole populations. The sample of early-type galaxies was selected from the Lyon-Meudon Extragalactic Data Archive (LEDA). This catalog at that time contained information on ~ 100,000 galaxies, of which ~ 40,000 had redshift and morphological data. Galaxies were selected using the following criteria: (i) Morphological Type T &amp;amp;lt; -1.5 (i.e. E, E-S0 and S0 galaxies). (ii) Virgo-corrected recession velocity V &amp;amp;lt;= 9,000 km s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;. (iii) Apparent Magnitude B&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;T&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;= 13.5. The redshift and apparent magnitude restrictions were chosen in order to minimize the effects of incompleteness on their sample. The LEDA catalogue is known to be 90 per cent complete at B&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;T&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; = 14.5, so the selection should be close to statistical completeness. The selection process produced ~ 700 objects. The authors then cross-correlated this list with a list of public ROSAT PSPC pointings. Only pointings within 30 arcminutes of the target were accepted, as, further off-axis, the PSPC point-spread function becomes large enough to make analysis problematic. This left 209 galaxies with X-ray data available. The authors also added data from previously published catalogs, ROSAT PSPC All-Sky Survey values from Beuing et al.

These other references use a range of models to fit the data, different wavebands, distances and blue luminosities. O&apos;Sullivan et al. corrected for these differences by converting the catalogs to a common set of values, as used for their own results. All of the X-ray luminosities have been converted to a common format based on a reliable distance scale (assuming H&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;0&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; = 75 km s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; Mpc&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;), and correcting for differences in spectral fitting techniques and waveband.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=etgalxray&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/etgalxray.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

Using these criteria, a catalog of 1325 extended source candidates at high galactic latitude (more than 20 degrees from the Galactic Equator) was produced. Cross-correlating this list with existing source catalogs yielded a reasonably comprehensive set of identifications for the sources in this list: over 400 were identified with known clusters of galaxies, while other objects were identified with galaxies, supernova remnants (SNR), active galactic nuclei (AGN), and stars. Whereas galaxies and SNR are often truly extended objects, AGN and stars can appear as extended ojects as a consequence of their soft X-ray spectra coupled with the broad point-spread function of the IPC at low energies. A total of 321 objects remain completely unidentified. Some of these may be heretofore uncatalogued clusters and groups of galaxies at moderate redshifts.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=exss&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/exss.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

In their paper, the authors present the Chandra X-ray sources detected in the Cetus field, along with an analysis of X-ray source counts, the stacked X-ray spectrum, and the optical identifications. A total of 188 X-ray sources were detected: 174 in the 0.5-7.0 keV band, 154 in the 0.5-2.0 keV band, and 113 in the 2.0-7.0 keV band. The X-ray source counts were derived and compared with the 172 ks exposure LALA Bootes field (available as the LALABOOCXO table in Browse). Interestingly, the authors find consistent hard-band X-ray source density, but a (36 +/- 12)% higher soft-band X-ray source density in the Cetus field. The weighted stacked spectrum of the detected X-ray sources can be fitted by a power law with photon index Gamma = 1.55. Based on the weighted stacked spectrum, the authors find that the resolved fraction of the X-ray background drops from (72 +/- 1)% at 0.5-1.0 keV to (63 +/- 4)% at 6.0-8.0 keV. The unresolved spectrum can be fitted by a power law over the range 0.5-7 keV, with a photon index Gamma = 1.22.

They present the cumulative flux distribution for the X-ray sample of 1034 hard sources and discuss the distribution of spectral hardness ratios. Their log N -log S in this intermediate flux range connects to those found in the Deep Fields, and by combining the data sets, they constrain the hard X-ray population over the flux range in which the differential number counts change slope and from which the bulk of the 2 - 10 keV X-ray background arises. They further investigate the log N - log S distribution separately for soft and hard sources in the sample, finding that while a clear change in slope is seen for the softer sample, the hardest sources are well described by a single power law down to the faintest fluxes, consistent with the notion that they lie at lower average redshift.

The GALEX TDS fields were designed to be in spatial and temporal coordination with the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey, which provides deep optical imaging and simultaneous optical transient detections via image differencing. The authors characterize the GALEX photometric errors empirically as a function of mean magnitude, and select sources that vary at the 5-sigma level in at least one epoch. They measure the statistical properties of the UV variability, including the structure function on timescales of days and years, and report classifications for the GALEX TDS sample using a combination of optical host colors and morphology, UV light curve characteristics, and matches to archival X-ray, and spectroscopy catalogs. The authors classify 62% of the sources as active galaxies (358 quasars and 305 active galactic nuclei), and 10% as variable stars (including 37 RR Lyrae, 53 M dwarf flare stars, and 2 cataclysmic variables). They detect a large-amplitude tail in the UV variability distribution for M-dwarf flare stars and RR Lyrae, reaching up to |Delta-M| = 4.6 and 2.9 magnitudes, respectively. The mean amplitude of the structure function for quasars on year timescales is five times larger than observed at optical wavelengths. The remaining unclassified sources include UV-bright extragalactic transients, two of which have been spectroscopically confirmed to be a young core-collapse supernova and a flare from the tidal disruption of a star by a dormant super-massive black hole. The authors calculate a surface density for variable sources in the UV with NUV &amp;amp;lt; 23 mag and |Delta-M| &amp;amp;gt; 0.2 mag of ~ 8.0, 7.7, and 1.8 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; for quasars, AGN, and RR Lyrae stars, respectively, and a surface density rate in the UV for transient sources, using the effective survey time at the cadence appropriate to each class, of ~15 and 52 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; yr&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; for M dwarfs and extragalactic transients, respectively.

They studied the variability of the detected sources, and performed a spectral analysis of the brightest sources in the field using multi-temperature models. The authors detected 167 X-ray sources above a 5-sigma detection threshold the properties of which are listed in this table, of which 58 are identified with known cluster members and candidates, from massive stars down to low-mass stars with spectral types of ~ M5.5.

Variability was observed in ~ 35% of late-type members or candidates, including six flaring sources. The emission from the central hot star Lambda Ori is dominated by plasma at 0.2 - 0.3 keV, with a weaker component at 0.7 keV, consistent with a wind origin. The coronae of late-type stars can be described by two plasma components with temperatures T&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;1&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ 0.3-0.8 keV and T&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ 0.8-3 keV, and subsolar abundances Z ~ 0.1-0.3 Z&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;sun&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;, similar to what is found in other star-forming regions and associations. No significant difference was observed between stars with and without circumstellar discs, although the smallness of the sample of stars with discs and accretion does not definitive conclusions to be drawn. The authors concluded that the X-ray properties of Lambda Ori late-type stars are comparable to those of the coeval Sigma Ori cluster, suggesting that stellar activity in Lambda Ori has not been significantly affected by the different ambient environment.

Differential source counts were determined down to &amp;amp;lt; ~10 mJy. The authors find no evidence for flattening of the counts towards lower flux densities as observed in deep radio surveys at higher frequencies, suggesting that their catalog is dominated by the classical radio-loud AGN population that explains the counts at higher flux densities. Combination with available deep 1.4 GHz observations yields an accurate determination of spectral indices for 417 sources down to the lowest 153 MHz flux densities, of which 16 have ultra-steep spectra with spectral indices below -1.3. The authors confirm that flattening of the median spectral index towards low flux densities also occurs at this frequency.

The authors analyzed the A-2 data in order to obtain a complete flux-limited sample of extragalactic X-ray sources. The region between galactic latitudes of -20 and +20 degrees was excluded to minimize contamination from galactic sources. A circle of 6 degrees radius around the Large Magellanic Cloud sources was also excluded to prevent confusion problems.

The lowest statistical significance for the existence of the sources included in this catalog is 5 sigma, as required by the maximum likelihood methods used by the authors to determine the log N - log S parameters.

The joint selection criterion within a 1.5 arcminute positional tolerance permitted the use of a low count rate threshold in each survey.

Preliminary identifications are offered for 105 of the 166 sources not previously reported in any EUV catalog: by far the most numerous (81) of the identifications are late-type (F-M) stars, while 18 are other stellar types, only 5 are white dwarfs, and none are extragalactic. The paucity of WDs and extragalactic objects may be explained by a strong horizon effect wherein interstellar absorption strongly limits the effective new-source search volume, and, thereby, selectively favors low-luminosity nearby sources over more luminous but distant objects.

The authors have investigated the characteristics of bright flares (detections in excess of 5 sigma) for a sample of SFXTs and their relation to the orbital phase. They have retrieved all Swift/BAT Transient Monitor light curves, and collected all detections in excess of 5 sigma from both daily- and orbital-averaged light curves in the time range from 2005 February 12 to 2013 May 31 (MJD 53413 - 56443). The authors also considered all on-board detections as recorded in the same time span and selected those within 4 arcminutes of each source in their sample and in excess of 5 sigma. This table contains the catalog of over a thousand Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) flares from 11 SFXTs, down to 15-150 keV fluxes of ~6 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-10&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;erg/cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;/s (daily timescale) and ~1.5 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-9&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;erg/cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;/s (orbital timescale, averaging ~800s) and spanning 100 months. The great majority of these flares are unpublished. This population is characterized by short (a few hundred seconds) and relatively bright (in excess of 100 milliCrab, 15-50 keV) events. In the hard X-ray, these flares last in general much less than a day. Clustering of hard X-ray flares can be used to indirectly measure the length of an outburst, even when the low-level emission is not detected. In their paper, the authors construct the distributions of flares, of their significance (in terms of sigma) and their flux as a function of orbital phase, to infer the properties of these binary systems. In particular, they observe a trend of clustering of flares at some phases as P_orb increases, as consistent with a progression from tight, circular or mildly eccentric orbits at short periods, to wider and more eccentric orbits at longer orbital periods. Finally, the authors estimate the expected number of flares for a given source for their limiting flux and provide the recipe for calculating them for the limiting flux of future hard X-ray observatories. The BAT observes 88% of the sky daily, on average, so it is ideally suited to detect flaring in hard X-ray sources. Since 2005-02-12, the BAT Transient Monitor (Krimm et al. 2013, ApJS, 209, 14) has been providing near real-time light curves in the 15-50 keV energy range of more than 900 sources with a mean variance for one-day mosaics of 5.3 milliCrab. Several flares from SFXTs are regularly caught every year by the BAT Transient Monitor (BATTM). The catalog contains a total of 1117 flares from 11 SFXT sources (the only other confirmed SFXT, IGR J11215-5952, never triggered the BAT: see Section 2.2 of the reference paper for more information about this source). They are divided into 46 BAT triggers (bat_subsample_flag = &apos;T&apos;, 43 in outbursts), 126 daily-averaged BATTM light curves (bat_subsample_flag = &apos;D&apos;), 267 orbital-averaged BATTM light curves (bat_subsample_flag = &apos;O&apos;), and 678 on-board detections (bat_subsample_flag = &apos;B&apos;). For each flare, the time of the occurrence, duration, flux, and significance are reported. Given the cut in sigma applied to the available BATTM and on-board detections, this catalog is a flux-limited sample of flares. Assuming a Crab-like spectrum (power-law of photon index 2.15), 5 sigma detections for one day and an average orbit typically correspond to fluxes of 5.98 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-10&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; and 1.46 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-9&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, respectively, in the 15-150 keV band (or 3.38 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-10&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; and 8.24 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-10&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; in the 15-50 keV band).</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=swbatsfxt&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/swbatsfxt.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The previous version of this table, based solely on the data presented in Paper I, contained the Chandra source list based on the first three-quarters of the GBS that had been observed as of the date of writing of that paper.

This trend is steeper than the model predictions which the authors attribute to the younger stellar age of the observed brightest cluster galaxies. This trend argues in favor of stronger evolution of the feedback from active galactic nuclei at z &amp;amp;lt; 1 compared to the models. The slope of the relation between the magnitude of the brightest cluster galaxy and the value of the gap does not evolve with redshift and is well reproduced by the models, indicating that the tidal galaxy stripping, put forward as an explanation of the occurrence of the magnitude gap, is both a dominant mechanism and sufficiently well modeled. In this study, the authors analyzed the XMM-Newton observations of the CFHTLS wide (W1) field as a part of the XMM-LSS survey (Pierre et al., 2007, MNRAS, 382, 279).

In this paper, the authors describe multi-frequency data designed to probe the emission mechanism that dominates in these faint radio sources. Their analysis is based on observations of the Lockman Hole (LH) using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) near Pune, India - the deepest 610-MHz imaging yet reported - together with 1.4-GHz imaging from the Very Large Array (VLA), which are well matched in resolution and sensitivity to the GMRT data: sigma&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;610MHz&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ 15 microJy/beam (uJy/beam), sigma}&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;1.4GHz&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ 6 uJy/beam, and full width at half-maximum (FWHM) ~ 5 arcseconds. The GMRT and VLA data are cross-matched to obtain the radio spectral indices for the faint radio emitters. During six 12-hr sessions in 2006 February and July, the authors obtained data at 610 MHz for three pointings (FWHM ~ 43 arcminutes) in the LH (see Table 1 of the reference paper for full details), separated by 11 arcminutes (the LOCKMAN-E, LOCK-3 and LHEX-4 fields), typically with 28 of the 30 antennas that comprise the GMRT. The total integration time in each field, after overheads, was 16 hr. The final image had a noise level in the central 100 arcmin&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; of 14.7 uJy/beam, the deepest map reported at 610 MHz as of the date of publication, despite the modest integration time. New and archival data were obtained at the same three positions using the National Radio Astronomy Observatory&apos;s VLA, largely in its B configuration. This table contains 1585 sources found in the LH field at 610 MHz by the GMRT. For 19 of the sources which have multiple components, the 34 individual components are listed as well.

At least 25% of the sources show significant variability.

The SPIRE beams are 18.1, 25.2 and 36.6 arcseconds at 250, 350 and 500 um, respectively.

The authors included sources with S/N greater than 3, whose completeness is estimated to be 50% (see Figure 7 of the reference paper), with a false detection rate less than 1%, and which had reasonable residuals (i.e., chi&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt; 10).

The observed correlations between the 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8 um variability suggests that we are observing variations in the heating of the inner disk due to changes in the accretion luminosity or rotating accretion hot spots.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=sporiabyso&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/sporiabyso.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The observational data were used to assess point source subtraction. Considering the brightest source (~1 Jy) in each field, the authors find that the residual artefacts are less than 1.5% in the most sensitive field (FIELD I). Considering all the sources in the fields, they find that the bulk of the image is free of artefacts, the artefacts being localized to the vicinity of the brightest sources.

The differential source count is well fitted with a single power law of slope -1.6. They find there is no evidence for flattening of the source counts towards lower flux densities which suggests that source population is dominated by the classical radio-loud active galactic nuclei.

It is based on Chandra observations of the central region of M 31. By combining eight Chandra ACIS-I observations which were taken between 1999 and 2001, the authors have identified 204 X-ray sources within the central ~17&apos;x17&apos; region of M 31, with a detection limit of ~2x10^35 erg/s. Of these 204 X-ray sources, 22 are identified with globular clusters, two with supernova remnants, nine with planetary nebulae, and nine with supersoft sources. By comparing individual images, about 50% of the sources were found to be variable on timescales of months. The authors also found 13 transients, with light curves showing a variety of shapes. They also extracted the energy spectra of the 20 brightest sources; they can be well fitted by a single power law with a mean photon index of 1.8. The spectral shapes of 12 sources were variable, suggesting that they went through state changes. All sources in the catalog have S/N &amp;amp;gt; 2.5 and only five have S/N &amp;amp;lt; 3.0. The detection limit for the sources varies across the image due to the variation of exposure time, background, and instrumental PSF, and is highest near the edges, where the PSF broadens rapidly and the exposure time is lowest. Over the inner 4&apos; of the field, the detection limit is 2.1 x 10^-4 ct/s, which is equivalent to an X-ray luminosity of about 2 x 10^35 erg/s.

This is referred to as the RASS/Green Bank sample: the HEASARC has abbreviated this to RASSGB to conform with the naming convention that we have used for other RASS catalogs (notice the catalog authors use the rather shorter acronym of RGB. Core flux densities and positions accurate to +/- 0.5&amp;amp;quot; are reported, as well as the GB measurements of the total radio emission, for each source. Because of the radio and X-ray selection criteria adopted, this catalog is believed to almost exclusively contain radio- and X-ray-loud active galaxies. These data are used in the paper by Laurent-Muehleisen et al. (1997) that contains the published version of this catalog to derive the core-to-lobe ratio of objects in this sample, and to discuss their core-dominance relative to samples of radio galaxies and BL Lac objects: the authors conclude that this sample is approximately an order of magnitude more core-dominated than the radio galaxy sample, but is more than an order of magnitude less core-dominated than highly-beamed BL Lac objects. The published version of this catalog comprised two main tables, Table 2 and Table 3. Table 2 gave the 5-GHz high resolution radio source properties for the 1861 Rosat/Green Bank sources for which subarcsecond positions and core radio flux densities had been obtained, while Table 3 gave the 5-GHz radio source properties for the 436 Rosat/Green Bank sources for which only low resolution data were obtained.

Studies of the X-ray properties in young clusters allow us to understand these mechanisms. One ideal target for this analysis is the Eagle Nebula (M 16), with its central cluster NGC 6611. At 1750 pc from the Sun, it harbors 93 OB stars, together with a population of low-mass stars from embedded protostars to disk-less Class III objects, with age &amp;amp;lt;= 3 Myr. The authors study an archival 78 ks Chandra/ACIS-I observation of NGC 6611 and two new 80-ks observations of the outer region of M 16, one centered on the Column V and the other on a region of the molecular cloud with ongoing star formation. They detect 1755 point sources with 1183 candidate cluster members (219 disk-bearing and 964 disk-less), studying the global X-ray properties of M 16 and comparing them with those of the Orion Nebula Cluster. The authors also compare the level of X-ray emission of Class II and Class III stars and analyze the X-ray spectral properties of OB stars. Their study supports the lower level of X-ray activity for the disk-bearing stars with respect to the disk-less members. The X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of M 16 is similar to that of Orion, supporting the universality of the XLF in young clusters. Eighty-five percent of the O-type stars of NGC 6611 have been detected in X-rays. With only one possible exception, they show soft spectra with no hard components, indicating that mechanisms for the production of hard X-ray emission in O stars are not operating in NGC 6611. The determination of the absorption corrected X-ray luminosity (L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;), as well as the plasma temperature (kT) and hydrogen column density (N&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;H&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;), requires the analysis of the X-ray spectra. The authors fit the observed spectra with thermal plasma (with both one and two temperatures) and power-law models. They use the APEC ionization-equilibrium thermal plasma code, assuming the sub-solar elemental abundances of Maggio et al. (2007, APJ, 660, 1462). The absorption was treated using the WABS model. The one-temperature (1T) thermal model was applied to all the sources with more than 25 counts, while the two-temperature (2T) thermal model was applied to each source with more than 80 counts. The power-law model has been applied to those sources with hard spectra for which the best-fit thermal model predicts a plasma temperature kT &amp;amp;gt; 5 keV. When more than one model has been used for a given source, the authors chose the best model by the chi-squared probability and visual inspection of the spectrum. This table contains a description of the X-ray properties of 1754 sources (one less than stated in the abstract of the reference paper) derived from three Chandra/ACIS-I observations, together with a source classification based on the optical and infrared properties of each source.

The catalog covers 24,402 square degrees, over Declinations south of +30 degrees and Galactic latitudes outside 10 degrees of the Galactic Plane, excluding some areas such as the Magellanic Clouds. It contains 307,455 radio sources with 20 separate flux density measurements across 72 - 231 MHz, selected from a time- and frequency-integrated image centered at 200 MHz, with a resolution of ~ 2 arcminutes. Over the catalogued region, the authors estimate that the catalog is 90% complete at 170 mJy, and 50% complete at 55 mJy, and large areas are complete at even lower flux density levels. Its reliability is 99.97% above the 5-sigma detection threshold, which itself is typically 50 mJy. These observations constitute the widest fractional bandwidth and largest sky area survey at radio frequencies to date, and calibrate the low frequency flux density scale of the southern sky to better than 10%.

This is the first in a series of publications describing the GLEAM survey results. GLEAM observes in week-long drift scan campaigns, with a single Dec strip observed each night. The observing bandwidth of 72-231 MHz is covered by shifting frequencies by 30.72 MHz every two minutes, avoiding the Orbcomm satellite constellation at 134-139 MHz. Thus, the frequencies of observation are 72-103, 103-134, 139-170, 170-200. and 200-231 MHz. These may be further subdivided for imaging purposes; in this study, the 30.72 MHz bandwidth is commonly subdivided into four 7.68 MHz sub-channels. The native channel resolution of these observations is 40 kHz and the native time resolution is 0.5 seconds. This paper concerns only data collected in the first year, i.e. four weeks between June 2013 and July 2014. The authors also do not image every observation, since the survey is redundant across approximately 50% of the observed RA ranges, and some parts are adversely acted by the Galactic plane and Centaurus A.

The average SEDs in the optical band are dominated by the host-galaxy light, especially at low X-ray luminosities and redshifts. There is also a trend between X-ray and mid-infrared luminosity: the AGN contribution in the infrared is higher at higher X-ray luminosities. The authors have calculated bolometric luminosities, bolometric corrections, stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs) for these sources using multi-component modeling to properly disentangle the emission associated with stellar light from that due to black hole accretion. For 90% of the sample, they also have the morphological classifications obtained with an upgraded version of the Zurich estimator of structural types (ZEST+). The authors find that, on average, type-2 AGN have lower bolometric corrections than type-1 AGN. Moreover, they confirm that the morphologies of AGN host-galaxies indicate that there is a preference for these type-2 AGN to be hosted in bulge-dominated galaxies with stellar masses greater than 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;10&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; solar masses.

In the first phase of the program, 22 pointings were used to cover a region of approximately 3 square degrees between 19 and 22 degrees in Galactic Longitude and +/-0.6 degrees in Galactic Latitude. In total, over 400 point X-ray sources have been resolved at &amp;amp;gt;=5-sigma significance, down to a flux limit of ~2 x 10^-14 erg/s/cm^2 (2-10 keV). The sources exhibit a very wide range of spectral hardness, with interstellar absorption identified as a major influence. The source populations detected in the soft (0.4 - 2 keV) band and hard (2 - 6 keV) band show surprisingly little overlap. The majority of the soft sources appear to be associated with relatively nearby stars with active stelaar coronae, judging from their high coincidence with bright stellar counterparts. The combination of the XGPS measurements in the hard X-ray band with the results from earlier surveys carried out by ASCA and Chandra reveals the form of the low-latitude X-ray source counts over 4 decades of flux. It appears that extragalactic sources dominate below ~10^-13 erg/s/cm^2 (2-10 keV), with a predominantly Galactic source population present above this flux threshold. The nature of the faint Galactic population observed by XMM-Newton remains uncertain, although cataclysmic variables and RS CVn systems may contribute substantially.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=xmmgps&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/xmmgps.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The authors used morphological star/galaxy separation, matching to an SDSS quasar catalog, an optical color-magnitude cut, and X-ray data-quality tests to create this catalog, from a sample of 2121 matched ChaMP/SDSS sources. Their cuts retain 92% of the spectroscopically confirmed stars in the original sample while excluding 99.6% of the 684 spectroscopically confirmed extragalactic sources. Fewer than 3% of the sources in their final catalog are previously identified stellar X-ray emitters. For 42 catalog members, spectroscopic classifications are available in the literature. New spectral classifications and H-alpha measurements are presented for an additional 79 stars. The catalog is dominated by main-sequence stars; the authors estimate the fraction of giants in ChESS to be ~10%. They identify seven giant stars (including a possible Cepheid and an RR Lyrae star) as ChaMP sources, as well as three cataclysmic variables. They derive distances from ~10 to 2000 pc for the stars in the catalog using photometric parallax relations appropriate for dwarfs on the main sequence and calculate their X-ray and bolometric luminosities.

While 115 of these sources can be identified with known cluster members, 58 X-ray sources are most likely new, still unidentified cluster members. About 80% of all known cluster members with masses between ~0.15 and 2 solar masses are visible as X-ray sources in the ACIS image. X-ray emission at levels of ~10^28 ergs/s was discovered from four of 13 known brown dwarfs and from three of 12 brown dwarf candidates in IC 348.

The authors studied the properties of the coronae of the young low-mass stars in IC 348, combining X-ray and optical/infrared data. The four existing Chandra observations of IC 348 were merged, thus providing a deeper and spatially more complete X-ray view than previous X-ray studies of the cluster. The authors compiled a comprehensive catalog of IC 348 members taking into account recent updates to the cluster census. Their data collection comprises fundamental stellar parameters, infrared excess indicating the presence of disks, H-alpha emission as a tracer of chromospheric emission or accretion, and mass accretion rates. The authors have detected 290 X-ray sources in four merged Chandra exposures, of which 185 are associated with known cluster members corresponding to a detection rate of ~ 60% for the cluster members of IC 348 identified in optical/infrared studies. According to the most recent spectral classification of IC 348 members, only four of the X-ray sources are brown dwarfs (spectral type M6 and later). The detection rate is highest for diskless Class III stars and increases with stellar mass. This may be explained with higher X-ray luminosities for higher mass and later evolutionary stage that is evident in the X-ray luminosity functions. In particular, the authors find that for the lowest examined masses (0.1 M&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;sun&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; - 0.25 M&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;sun&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;) there is a difference between the X-ray luminosity functions of accreting and non-accreting stars (classified on the basis of their H-alpha emission strength) as well as those of disk-bearing and diskless stars (classified on the basis of the slope of the spectral energy distribution). These differences disappear for higher masses. This is related to the finding that the L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;x&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;/L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;bol&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ratio is non-constant across the mass/luminosity sequence of IC 348 with a decrease towards lower luminosity stars.

MOXC consists of 20,623 X-ray point sources from 12 MSFRs with distances ranging from 1.7 kpc to 50 kpc, and comprises Table 3 of the reference paper. In their paper, the authors show the morphology of the unresolved X-ray emission that remains after the cataloged X-ray point sources are excised from the ACIS data, in the context of Spitzer and WISE observations that trace the bubbles, ionization fronts, and photon-dominated regions that characterize MSFRs. In previous work, they have found that this unresolved X-ray emission is dominated by hot plasma from massive star wind shocks. This diffuse X-ray emission is found in every MOXC MSFR, clearly demonstrating that massive star feedback (and the several-million-degree plasmas that it generates) is an integral component of MSFR physics. The Chandra observations used for the Massive Star-forming Regions Omnibus X-ray Catalog (MOXC) are summarized in Table 2 of the reference paper and have dates ranging from 2000-04-03 to 2013-01-31 for the 12 MSFRs: the 7 MYStIX targets NGC 6334, NGC 6357, M 16, M 17, W 3, W 4 and NGC 3576, and the 5 &amp;amp;quot;beyond-MYStIX&amp;amp;quot; targets G333.6-0.2, W 51A, G29.96-0.02, NGC 3603 and 30 Doradus. A similar table to MOXC for other MYStIX targets was presented by Kuhn et al. (2013, ApJS, 209, 27, available as the HEASARC MYSTIXXRAY table). The main difference between that table and the MOXC version is that the present authors have chosen to omit absorption-corrected X-ray source luminosities from the XPHOT algorithm (Getman et al. 2010, ApJ, 708, 1760) herein, because those quantities are given in Broos et al. (2013, ApJS, 209, 32, available as the HEASARC MYSTIXMPCM table) for relevant MYStIX X-ray sources (those classified as pre-main sequence stars). For beyond-MYStIX targets, the authors chose to postpone XPHOT calculations until the X-ray sources were classified, since XPHOT estimates are only appropriate for pre-MS stars. The XPHOT code is available (Getman et al. 2012, Astrophysics Source Code Library, record ascl.soft12002) if others wish to use it on MOXC sources. All photometric quantities in this table are apparent (not corrected for absorption).

NGC 253 is a local, starbursting spiral galaxy with strong X-ray emission from hot gas, as well as many point sources. The authors have conducted a spectral survey of the X-ray population of NGC 253 using a deep XMM-Newton observation. NGC 253 only accounts for ~20 per cent of the XMM-Newton EPIC field of view, allowing them to identify ~ 100 X-ray sources that are unlikely to be associated with NGC 253. Hence, they were able to make a direct estimate of contamination from, for example, foreground stars and background galaxies. X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) of galaxy populations are often used to characterize their properties. There are several methods for estimating the luminosities of X-ray sources with few photons. The authors have obtained spectral fits for the brightest 140 sources in the 2003 XMM-Newton observation of NGC 253, and compare the best-fitting luminosities of those 69 non-nuclear sources associated with NGC 253 with luminosities derived using other methods. They find the luminosities obtained from these various methods to vary systematically by a factor of up to 3 for the same data; this is largely due to differences in absorption. The authors therefore conclude that assuming Galactic absorption is probably unwise; rather, one should measure the absorption for the population. In addition, they find that standard estimations of the background contribution to the X-ray sources in the field are insufficient, and that the background active galactic nuclei (AGN) may be systematically more luminous than previously expected. However, the excess in their measured AGN XLF with respect to the expected XLF may be due to an as yet unrecognized population associated with NGC253. XMM-Newton observations are susceptible to periods of high background levels, caused by increased flux of solar particles. The authors screened the data from each of the EPIC cameras (MOS1, MOS2 and pn), to remove flaring intervals. This process resulted in ~ 46 ks of good time for the pn and ~ 69 ks for the MOS cameras. The authors combined the cleaned MOS and pn data, and ran the source detection algorithm provided with the XMM-Newton data analysis suite SAS version 7.0. They accepted sources with maximum-likelihood detections &amp;amp;gt; 10 (equivalent to 4 sigma).</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=ngc253xmm&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/ngc253xmm.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

Ratios of these three bands constituted X-ray &apos;colors&apos; which in turn were used to estimate the shape of the spectrum over the IPC bandpass.

The only revisions from the 3B catalog are improved locations for the trigger #s 741, 2311, and 3155. Bursts since the end of the 1B catalog (March 1992) occurred when the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory (CGRO) tape recorders were experiencing numerous errors. Consequently, there are gaps in the data of many bursts that preclude valid measurement of peak flux, peak rate, fluence, or duration. Peak rates on the 1 second timescale from each detector are almost always available. These data (called MAXBC rates) can be used to determine burst location. Previous difficulties with this data type have been largely removed, and we now believe that the systematic errors for MAXBC-located bursts are the same as for bursts located with other data types. It is still true however, that the MAXBC-located bursts usually have larger statistical errors than would be the case if another data type were available. The parameter called comments_position in this database contains comments on MAXBC-located bursts. A number of CGRO and BATSE flight software changes have significantly reduced the problem of data gaps since March of 1993.

Using the Earth Occultation Technique to extract flux information, a catalog of sources using data from the BATSE large area detectors has been prepared. The first part of the catalog consists of results from the monitoring of 58 sources, mostly Galactic. For these sources, the authors included tables of flux and spectral data, and outburst times for transients, in their published paper. The authors also performed a deep-sampling of 180 objects (including the aforementioned 58 objects) combining data from the entire 9.1 year BATSE dataset. (One extra object, GRO J1735-27, has been added in this HEASARC table in addition to the 179 objects discussed in the reference paper). Source types considered were primarily accreting binaries, but a small number of representative active galaxies, X-ray-emitting stars, and supernova remnants were also included. The deep sample results include definite detections of 83 objects and possible detections of 36 additional objects. The definite detections spanned three classes of sources: accreting black hole and neutron star binaries, active galaxies and supernova remnants. Flux data for the deep sample are presented in four energy bands: 20-40, 40-70, 70-160, and 160-430 keV. The limiting average flux level (9.1 years) for the sample varies from 3.5 to 20 mCrab (5 sigma) between 20 and 430 keV, depending on systematic error, which in turn is primarily dependent on the sky location. To strengthen the credibility of detection of weaker sources (5-25 mCrab), the authors generated Earth occultation images, searched for periodic behavior using FFT and epoch folding methods, and critically evaluated the energy-dependent emission in the four flux bands.

Along with other recent discussions, the authors suggest that this trend may represent the effects of feedback, which systematically inhibited early star formation at either very low or very high galaxy mass, but which had its minimum effect for intermediate masses. Their results strongly reinforce recent proposals that GC formation efficiency appears to be most nearly proportional to the galaxy halo mass M&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;halo&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;.

They detected eleven new possible candidate members from the 2MASS (CDS Cat. &amp;amp;lt;II/246&amp;amp;gt;) catalog.

They detected significant variability in ~ 40% of late-type members or candidates, including 10 flaring sources; rotational modulation was detected in one K-type star and possibly in another 3 or 4 stars. Spectral analysis of the brightest sources shows typical quiescent temperatures in the range T&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;1&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ 0.3 - 0.8 keV and T&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ 1 - 3 keV, with subsolar abundances Z ~ 0.1 - 0.3 solar, similar to what is found in other star-forming regions and associations. The authors find no significant difference in the spectral properties of classical and weak-lined T Tauri stars, although classical T Tauri stars tend to be less X-ray luminous than weak-lined T Tauri stars. XMM-Newton observations of the sigma Ori cluster, centered on the hot star sigma Ori AB, were carried out as part of the Guaranteed Time of Roberto Pallavicini using both the EPIC MOS and PN cameras and the RGS instrument.

The survey reaches sensitivity limits of ~1.1 x 10^-16 and ~6.7 x 10^-16 ergs cm^-2 s^-1 for the 0.5-2.0 and 2-8 keV bands, respectively. 762 distinct X-ray point sources are detected within the E-CDF-S exposure; 589 of these sources are new (i.e., not previously detected in the ~1 Ms CDF-S). This brings the total number of X-ray point sources detected in the E-CDF-S region to 915 (via the E-CDF-S and ~1 Ms CDF-S observations). Source positions are determined using matched-filter and centroiding techniques; the median positional uncertainty is ~0.35&amp;amp;quot;.

The Card Catalog originated with Raymond Smith Dugan in the 1930&apos;s, who published from it the first edition of &amp;amp;quot;A Finding List for Observers of Eclipsing Variables&amp;amp;quot; (Dugan 1934, Princeton Univ. Obs. Contrib. No. 15). Successive editions of FL were subsequently published by Pierce (1947, Princeton Univ. Obs. Contrib. No. 22), by Wood (1953, Univ. Pennsylvania Astron. Series, Vol. VIII), by Koch et al. (1963, Univ. Pennsylvania Astron. Series, Vol. IX), and by Wood et al. (1980, Univ. Pennsylvania Astron. Series, Vol. XII). The FL was conceived as an aid to observers of eclipsing variables in selecting an observing program efficiently from the collection of all known data in an easy-to-use format. Although this format has changed over the years to meet existing requirements, the basic information content remains the same. The current edition differs from previous ones in the extension of the magnitude limit at minimum light from 13 to 15. In earlier editions, a binary system was not included unless the editors were reasonably certain that the system was indeed an eclipsing or (rarely) an ellipsoidal variable. The fifth edition includes all systems that the editors were fairly certain are either eclipsing or radiometrically variable binaries. The catalog fields are Finding List number; star name; position (given in the original catalog in equinox 1900); blue magnitude at maximum light; bandpass of maximum light; depth of primary minimum in same bandpass; bandpass primary minimum; depth of secondary minimum and its bandpass; spectral class of star eclipsed at primary light and optional uncertainty character; spectral class of star eclipsed at secondary light; most recent reliable epoch of primary minimum; most recent orbital period; duration of primary minimum; duration of totality of primary minimum; BD, CoD, CPD, and HD number; alternate designations of system; and codes indicating the nature of the system.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=woodebcat&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/woodebcat.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

To constrain the nature of each X-ray source, they carried out cross-correlations with multi-wavelength data sets. They searched overlapping Hubble Space Telescope observations for optical counterparts to their X-ray detections to provide preliminary classifications for each X-ray source as a likely X-ray binary, background active galactic nucleus, supernova remnant, or foreground star.

ACIS-Extract (AE) was run a final time on the source list that was produces after an initial run of wavdetect followed by several iterations of AE, and the Poisson probability of not being a source (pns) value was computed in each of the following nine energy bands: 0.5 - 8.0, 0.5 - 2.0, 2.0 - 8.0, 0.5 - 1.0, 1.0 - 2.0, 2.0 - 4.0, 4.0 - 8.0, 0.35 - 1.0 or 0.35 - 8.0 keV.

They find that, despite measuring significant variability in a considerable fraction of sources, snapshot observations provide a consistent determination of the XLF of M81.

The AT20G-Deep Pilot survey was carried out with he ATCA in 2009 July, shortly after the telescope was provided with a new wide-bandwidth correlator, the CABB. As a result of this upgrade to the telescope, the observing bandwidth was increased by a factor of 16, from 2x128 to 2x2048 MHz, in all bands (ranging from 1.1 to 105 GHz), greatly increasing the sensitivity of continuum observations. These observations were made in continuum mode using two 2048-MHz CABB bands centered at 19 and 21 GHz, with each 2048-MHz band divided into 2048 1-MHz channels. All four Stokes parameters were measured.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=atcdfsss82&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/atcdfsss82.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

In the same field, they already had multiband photometry down to I&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;AB&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; = 25, and spectroscopic observations were to be obtained during the VIRMOS VLT survey. The homogeneous sensitivity over the whole field allowed them to derive a complete sample of 1054 radio sources (5-sigma limit) down to a limit of 0.08 mJy. In their paper, the authors give a detailed description of the data reduction and of the analysis of the radio observations, with particular care to the effects of clean bias and bandwidth smearing, and of the methods used to obtain the catalog of radio sources. To estimate the effect of the resolution bias on their observations, they have modeled the effective angular-size distribution of the sources in their sample and they have used this distribution to simulate a sample of radio sources. Finally, they present the radio count distribution down to 0.08 mJy derived from the catalog. Their counts are in good agreement with the best fit derived from earlier surveys, and are about 50% higher than the counts in the Hubble Deep Field (HDF). The radio count distribution clearly shows, with extremely good statistics, the change in the slope for the sub-mJy radio sources. 19 of the 1054 radio sources were fitted with multiple components. In such cases, the authors list in the catalog an entry for each of the components, identified with a trailing letter (A, B, C or D) in the source name, and an entry for the whole source, identified with a trailing T in the source name. In these cases the total flux was calculated using the task TVSTAT, which allows the integration of the map values over irregular areas, and the sizes are the largest angular sizes.

The current catalog has been supplemented by inclusion of published data from more recent radio surveys, in particular, the Parkes Multibeam (PM) Pulsar Survey (Manchester et al. 2001, MNRAS, 328, 17-35) [available at the HEASARC as the PMPULSAR table] and the Swinburne Intermediate Latitude Pulsar Survey (Edwards et al. 2001, MNRAS, 326, 358-374), both made using the ATNF Parkes 64-m radio telescope. Binary parameters for known binary pulsars are also included as well as all available astrometric and spin parameter information for all pulsars. The catalog includes all published rotation-powered pulsars. Two separate small subsets of pulsars detected only at high energies are also included in the current table: the first group comprises X-ray and gamma-ray pulsars which are apparently powered by spin-down energy, but which have not been detected at radio wavelengths, while the second group contains anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) and soft-gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) for which coherent pulsations have been detected. Accretion-powered pulsars such as Her X-1 and the recently discovered X-ray millisecond pulsars such as SAX J1808.4-3658 are not included in this table, however.

The authors assess the quality of the data, which was gathered in the 1992-1994 time period, and the resulting source parameters. They describe the population of catalogued sources, and compare it to samples from complementary catalogs. In particular, they find 122 radio sources with highly probable association with gamma-ray sources observed by the orbiting Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), and 11 more radio sources with possible associations with Fermi LAT sources. This Australia Telescope PMN (ATPMN) catalog lists the source measurements of flux density, position and structure of a selection of sources from the PMN catalog. Each catalog entry corresponds to a discrete source observed by the ATCA. In many cases, a single PMN source yields several ATPMN sources. Apart from the name of the parent PMN source, there is no indication of physical association: multiple sources in the one field may be aligned by chance, or may be components of the one object. This catalog contains the following information for each source: position; the flux density at 4.8 and 8.6 GHz; uncertainties in each flux density; the source size modelled as an ellipse (major axes, minor axes, position angle) of the best fit for a Gaussian brightness distribution; the spectral index computed between 4.8 and 8.6 GHz; the uncertainty in the spectral index; a code denoting the epoch of the observation. In the table as given in the original reference, the positions were given with varying degrees of precision, from 0.001 to 1 second of time in RA and from 0.01 to 1 arcsecond in Declination. The authors state in Section 4 of the reference paper that the error in a position coordinate is less than 10 times the final digit given in the coordinate. The positions as displayed in this table do not reflect this system: e.g., a Dec value displayed as &apos;-79 58 34.00&apos; may have been given in the original table as &apos;-79 58 34.00&apos; or &apos;-79 58 34.0&apos; or &apos;-79 58 34&apos;. To recover this information about positional precision the HEASARC has created two additional parameters ra_accuracy and dec_accuracy which list the number of digits after the decimal point given in the original table for the RA and Dec, respectively. Thus, if ra_accuracy = 3, the RA was given to a precision of 0.001 s in the original table, implying that the actual error in RA was less than 10 * 0.001 = 0.01 s.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=atpmncat&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/atpmncat.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

Most of the sources have plasma temperatures between 0.6 and 3 keV, but a few sources show higher temperatures up to ~7 keV. Comparison with K-band source counts indicates that all of the known cluster members with K &amp;amp;lt; 12 and about half of the members with K &amp;amp;gt; 12 were detected. (K ~= 11, the peak of the K-band luminosity function, corresponds to 0.2 - 0.4 M_solar stars for a cluster age of ~1 Myr). Seven of the 20 known YSOs in NGC 1333 which are producing jets or molecular outflows were detected, as well as one deeply embedded object without outflows. No evident difference in X-ray emission of young stars with and without outflows is found. This present table contains X-ray, optical and near-infrared information on the 109 X-ray sources that were detected above a source significance threshold of 1 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-6&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; in any of 3 energy bands: soft: 0.5 - 2.0 keV, hard: 2.0 - 8.0 keV, or full: 0.5 - 8.0 keV, excluding 8 sources that were deemed to be spurious on visual examination of the images. The faintest on-axis source emerging from the wavelet detection procedure has 5 extracted counts, corresponding to a source of log L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ 28.0 in the total (0.5 - 8.0 keV) band for a source with negligible interstellar absorption (A&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;V&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ 1) and a typical source spectrum of a kT ~ 1 keV thermal plasma. This limit increases to 28.6 (29.3) if the absorption is increased to A&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;V&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ 5 (10). The sensitivity decreases by a factor of 4 at the edge of the field compared to the central regions. 80 of the significant 109 sources (73%) have counterparts in a non-X-ray band. This table does not include 18 tentative X-ray sources listed in Table 3 of the reference paper that were found by the authors by searching for concentrations of photons spatially coincident with known sources from near-IR, mm/sub-mm, and radio catalogs of this region which did not reach the detection significance given above.

This is the largest Chandra survey ever conducted at such depth, and only one XMM-Newton survey reaches a lower flux limit in the hard 2.0-8.0 keV band. The authors detect 651 unique sources: 587 using a conservative source-detection threshold (identified by source_type = &apos;P&apos; for primary source) and 64 (identified by source_type = &apos;S&apos; for secondary source) using a lower source-detection threshold. These are combined in this HEASARC representation but were presented as two separate catalogs (Table 4 contained the primary sources, and Table 5 the secondary sources) in the original reference paper. Of the 651 total sources, 561 are detected in the full 0.5-8.0 keV band, 529 in the soft 0.5-2.0 keV band, and 335 in the hard 2.0-8.0 keV band.

These AGNs show a significant difference in the mid-IR to X-ray flux ratio for obscured and unobscured AGNs, which can be explained by the effects of dust self-absorption on the former.

These close binaries are thought to play an important role in the stability of the clusters by liberating energy and delaying the inevitable core collapse of globular clusters. The inventory of close binaries and their identification is therefore essential. This table contains some of the results, namely an X-ray source catalog, from XMM-Newton observations of the Galactic globular cluster NGC 2808. The authors use X-ray spectral and variability analysis combined with ultra-violet observations made with the XMM-Newton optical monitor and published data from the Hubble Space Telescope to identify sources associated with the clusters. They compare the results of their observations with estimates from population synthesis models. Five sources out of 96 X-ray sources detected above 4-sigma significance are likely to be related to NGC 2808. The authors find one quiescent neutron star low-mass X-ray binary candidate in the core of NGC 2808, and propose that the majority of the central sources in NGC 2808 are cataclysmic variables.

In the reference paper, the authors discuss the radio properties of 266 cataloged radio sources, of which 198 are above a 20-cm completeness level reaching down to 43 microJanskies (uJy) at the center of the field. Survey observations made at 6 cm over a more limited region cover the original CDF-S to a comparable level of sensitivity as the 20-cm observations. Of 266 cataloged radio sources, 52 have X-ray counterparts in the CDF-S and a further 37 have counterparts in the E-CDF-S area not covered by the 1 Ms exposure. Using a wide range of material, the authors have found optical or infrared counterparts for 254 radio sources, of which 186 have either spectroscopic or photometric redshifts. Three radio sources have no apparent counterpart at any other wavelength. Measurements of the 20-cm radio flux density at the position of each CDF-S X-ray source detected a further 30 radio sources (not included in this table) above a conservative 3-sigma detection limit. X-ray and sub-millimeter observations have been traditionally used as a measure of AGN and star formation activity, respectively. These new observations probe the faint end of both the star formation and radio galaxy/AGN population, as well as the connection between the formation and evolution of stars and SMBHs. Both of the corresponding gravitational and nuclear fusion-driven energy sources can lead to radio synchrotron emission. AGN and radio galaxies dominate at high flux densities. Although emission from star formation becomes more prominent at the microJansky levels reached by deep radio surveys, even for the weakest sources, an apparent significant contribution from low-luminosity AGN as well as from star formation is still found. Notice that are 319 entries in this table corresponding to the 266 catalogued radio sources, due to the fact that some of these sources have multiple components.

A visual screening process was applied to classify the reliability of the correlations. 547 correlations have been quoted as reliable identifications. From these, 349 sources are known to be active galaxies. Although for the other sources no hints for activity were found in the literature, 69% of those for which we have distances show X-ray luminosities exceeding those of normal galaxies, a clear sign that these galaxies also own hitherto unreported X-ray active components. Some objects are located inside or in the direction of a known group or cluster of galaxies. Their X-ray flux may therefore be in part affected by hot gas emission. In the paper, luminosity and log N-log S distributions are used to characterize different subsamples. Nuclei that are both optically and X-ray active are found predominantly in spirals. Two special source samples are defined, one with candidates for X-ray emission from hitherto unknown groups or clusters of galaxies, and one with high X-ray luminosity sources, that are likely candidates to possess hitherto unreported active galactic nuclei.

In the 17&apos; x 17&apos; area of the Chandra ACIS-I image there were approximately 3400 SWIRE near-IR sources with 4-sigma detections in at least two Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) bands and 988 sources detected at 24 micron (um) with the Multiband Imaging Photometer (MIPS) brighter than a 24-um flux S_24 ~ 0.1 mJy. Of these, 102 IRAC and 59 MIPS sources have Chandra counterparts, out of a total of 122 X-ray sources present in the area with 0.5 - 8 keV flux &amp;amp;gt; 10-15 erg cm^-2 s^-1. The SWIRE ELAIS N1 field was imaged by the IRAC multiband camera on Spitzer in 2004 January and with MIPS in early 2004 February. The observations were centered at the position (16h 00m, +59d 01&apos;). The X-ray observations were taken as part of the ELAIS Deep X-ray Survey (EDXS) and are described in detail in Manners et al. (2003, MNRAS, 343, 293). For this analysis, the Chandra Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) observation of 75 ks centered on (16h 10m 20.11s, +54d 33&apos; 22.3&amp;amp;quot;) (J2000.0) in the ELAIS N1 region. The aim point was focused on the ACIS-I chips, which consist of four CCDs arranged in a 2 x 2 array covering an area of 16.9&apos; x 16.9&apos; (286 square arcmin). Bad pixels and columns were removed, and data were filtered to eliminate high background times (due to strong solar flares), leaving 71.5 ks of good data after filtering. Counts-to-photon calibration assumed a standard power-law model spectrum with photon index Gamma = 1.7. Sources were detected to flux levels of 2.3 x 10^-15 erg s^-1 cm^-2 in the 0.5 - 8 keV band, 9.4 x 10^-16 erg s^-1 cm^-2 in the 0.5 - 2 keV band, and 5.2 x 10^-15 erg s^-1 cm^-2 in the 2 - 8 keV band. Sources are detectable to these flux limits over 90% of the nominal survey area. For this analysis, the authors used sources detected in the full band of ACIS-I only, of which there are 122 in the N1 region. Of the 102 sources in common between Chandra and SWIRE, 83 have significant detections in the separate soft X-ray band (0.5 - 2 keV) and 64 are detected in the hard (2 - 8 keV) band. A simple near-neighbor search was performed to cross-correlate the Spitzer and Chandra source catalogs within the Chandra ACIS-I chip image, using a d = 5&amp;amp;quot; search radius (roughly the quadratic sum of the astrometric errors). All together, the authors found reliably associated counterparts for 102 of the 122 Chandra sources (84% in total). The vast majority of these were detected with the IRAC channels 1 and 2 (3.6 and 4.5 um): 100 of the 122 Chandra sources in each case. As many as 59 Chandra objects are reliably associated with MIPS 24 um sources (all of them having IRAC counterparts), and just 1 had a MIPS 70 um counterpart. Of the 102 Spitzer-identified Chandra sources, three turned out to correspond to Galactic stars on the basis of their position on color-magnitude plots and optical morphology and were excluded from the subsequent analysis (and this table).</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=swirecxo&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/swirecxo.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The aims of this study were to study the X-ray source populations in M 83 and to calculate the X-ray luminosity functions of X-ray binaries for different regions of the galaxy. The authors detected 189 sources in the XMM-Newton field of view in the energy range of 0.2-12 keV. They constrained their nature by means of spectral analysis, hardness ratios, studies of the X-ray variability, and cross-correlations with catalogs in X-ray, optical, infrared, and radio wavelengths. The authors identified and classified 12 background objects, five foreground stars, two X-ray binaries, one supernova remnant candidate, one super-soft source candidate and one ultra-luminous X-ray source. Among these sources, they classified for the first time three active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidates. the authors derived X-ray luminosity functions for the X-ray sources in M 83 in the 2-10 keV energy range, within and outside the D&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;25&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ellipse, correcting the total X-ray luminosity function for incompleteness and subtracting the AGN contribution. The X-ray luminosity function inside the D25 ellipse is consistent with that previously observed by Chandra. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test shows that the X-ray luminosity function of the outer disc and the AGN luminosity distribution are uncorrelated with a probability of ~99.3%. The authors also found that the X-ray sources detected outside the D&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;25&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ellipse and the uniform spatial distribution of AGNs are spatially uncorrelated with a significance of 99.5%. They interpret these results as an indication that part of the observed X-ray sources are X-ray binaries in the outer disc of M 83. The authors analyzed the public archival XMM-Newton data of M 83 (PIs: Watson, Kuntz). Three observations were analyzed, one pointing at the center of the galaxy (obs.1) and two in the south, which covered the outer arms with a young population of stars discovered with GALEX.

These images - with a total exposure time of 154 ks - are the deepest X-ray observations obtained as of 2004 of M 87. The authors identified 174 X-ray point sources, (contained in this Browse table) of which ~ 150 are likely LMXBs. This LMXB catalog was combined with deep F475W and F850LP images taken with ACS on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) (as part of the ACS Virgo Cluster Survey) to examine the connection between LMXBs and globular clusters in M87.

In addition, the authors used 38 ks of archival ACIS observations of M 87 taken on 2000 July 29. These data were processed in a fashion similar to the 2002 July data, except that no CTI correction was possible because the data were telemetered in graded mode. All reductions were carried out with CIAO, version 2.3, coupled with CALDB, version 2.21. In order to combine the event files into a single image for point-source detection, the authors obtained relative offsets by matching the celestial coordinates of two X-ray point sources.

The aim of this catalog is to provide easy access to the basic information on the X-ray sources and their counterparts in other wavelength ranges (UV, optical, IR, radio). Most of the sources have been identified as Be/X-ray binaries. Some sources, however, are only tentatively identified as HMXBs on the basis of a transient character and/or a hard X-ray spectrum. Further identification in other wavelength bands is needed to finally determine the nature of these sources.

MYStIX is a multi-wavelength census of young stellar members of 20 nearby (distances &amp;amp;lt; 4 kpc), Galactic, star-forming regions (SFRs) that contain at least one O-type star. All regions have data available from the Spitzer Space Telescope consisting of GLIMPSE or other published catalogs for 11 regions and results of the authors&apos; own photometric analysis of archival data for the remaining 9 regions. The authors also reduced the GLIMPSE data for the W 3 SFR using the aperture photometry method in order to compare the results obtained using the two methods (see Section 3.4.2 of the reference paper). The reference paper seeks to construct deep and reliable catalogs of sources from the Spitzer images. Mid-infrared study of these regions faces challenges of crowding and high nebulosity. These new catalogs typically contain fainter sources than existing Spitzer studies, which improves the match rate to Chandra X-ray sources that are likely to be young stars, but increases the possibility of spurious point-source detections, especially peaks in the nebulosity. IRAC color-color diagrams help distinguish spurious detections of nebular polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission from the infrared excess associated with dusty disks around young stars. The distributions of sources on the mid-infrared color-magnitude and color-color diagrams reflect differences between MYStIX regions, including astrophysical effects such as stellar ages and disk evolution. The GLIMPSE (Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire) Survey is a Legacy Science Program of the Spitzer Space Telescope to study star formation in the disk of the Milky Way Galaxy. It contains six MYStIX regions - the Lagoon Nebula, the Trifid Nebula, NGC 6334, the Eagle Nebula, M 17, and NGC 6357 - within the 2-degree wide strip along the Galactic equator (GLIMPSE I and II data releases). Furthermore, Spitzer images and photometry for RCW 38 and NGC 3576 come from the Vela-Carina survey (Majewski et al. 2007, Spitzer Proposal 40791), using a similar observing strategy with mosaicking and photometric analysis as performed with the GLIMPSE pipeline.

This extends and complements the X-ray survey of the central Carina nebula regions performed in the Chandra Carina Complex Project (CCCP, available in the HEASARC database system as the CARINACXO table). Using deep near-infrared images from their recent VISTA survey of the Carina nebula complex, their comprehensive Spitzer point-source catalog, and optical archive data, the authors identify counterparts for 75% of these X-ray sources. The aimpoint of the ACIS-I observation was set to be RA(J2000) = 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;h&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; 37&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;m&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; 36.6&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;s&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, Dec(J2000) = -58&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;o&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; 41&apos; 18&amp;amp;quot;. This position is close to the center of the H II region, and allows both the stellar cluster NGC 3324 and the cluster G286.38-0.26 to be in the inner parts of the field-of-view, where the point-spread function is still very good. The pointing roll angle (i.e., the orientation of the detector with respect to the celestial north direction) was 138.35&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;o&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;. The ACIS field-of-view is just wide enough to cover the full spatial extent of the optically bright Gum 31 H II region and some parts of the surrounding dust shell (see Fig. 1 of the reference paper). The ACIS-I field of view is 17&apos; x 17&apos;, which corresponds to 11.3 p x 11.3 pc at the Gum 31 distance of 2.3 kpc). The total net exposure time of the observation was 68,909s (19.14 h). The details of the source detection procedures are described in Section 21. of the reference paper. The final X-ray catalog contains 679 individual point sources. The number of extracted counts ranges from 3 for the faintest sources, up to 920 for the strongest source, while the median value is 11 counts. This table contains the basic X-ray properties and near- and mid-infrared photometry of the X-ray sources detected in the Gum 31 field. The details of the IR matching to the X-ray sources are given in Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 of the reference paper.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=cargm31cxo&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/cargm31cxo.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

They found 1 central star of a planetary nebula, 2 new oxygen spectra on helium-atmosphere white dwarfs, 71 DQs, 42 hot DO/PG1159s, 171 white dwarf+main-sequence star binaries, 206 magnetic DAHs, 327 continuum-dominated DCs, 397 metal-polluted white dwarfs, 450 helium-dominated white dwarfs, 647 subdwarfs and 6887 new hydrogen-dominated white dwarf stars. The targeted white dwarfs were required to be point sources with clean photometry, and to have USNO-B Catalog counterparts (Monet et al.. 2003, AJ, 125, 984, CDS Cat. I/284).

Objects satisfying the selection criteria that had not been observed previously by the SDSS were denoted by the WHITEDWARF_NEW target flag, while those with prior SDSS spectra are assigned the WHITEDWARF_SDSS flag.

Many methods to separate the two populations are used in the literature, based on X-ray and multi-wavelength properties. The authors aim at a detailed test of the classification schemes and to study the X-ray properties of the resulting samples. They build on a sample of galaxies selected at 1.4 GHz in the VLA-COSMOS survey, classified by Smolcic et al. (2008, ApJS, 177, 14) according to their optical colors and also observed by Chandra. A similarly selected control sample of AGN is also used for comparison. The authors review some X-ray based classification criteria and check how they affect the sample composition. The efficiency of the classification scheme devised by Smolcic et al. (2008) is such that ~30% of composite/misclassified objects are expected because of the higher X-ray brightness of AGN with respect to galaxies. The latter fraction is actually 50% in the X-ray detected sources, while it is expected to be much lower among X-ray undetected sources. Indeed, the analysis of the stacked spectrum of undetected sources shows, consistently, strongly different properties between the AGN and galaxy samples. X-ray based selection criteria are then used to refine both samples. The radio/X-ray luminosity correlation for star-forming (SF) galaxies is found to hold with the same X-ray/radio ratio valid for nearby galaxies. Some evolution of the ratio may be possible for sources at high redshift or high luminosity, though it is likely explained by a bias arising from the radio selection. Finally, in their paper the authors discuss the X-ray number counts of star-forming galaxies from the VLA- and C-COSMOS surveys according to different selection criteria, and compare them to the similar determination from the Chandra Deep Fields. The classification scheme proposed here may find application in future works and surveys. This table contains the catalogs of radio-selected SF- and AGN-candidate sources with an X-ray detection in C-COSMOS which were contained in Tables 2 and 3 of the reference paper, respectively.

Limiting magnitudes vary from field to field, ranging from 15.49 to 16.67. The overall completeness is estimated to be 84%, but that figure and the relative contributions of magnitude, color, and accidental errors vary depending on the magnitude and color distribution of the spectroscopic subsample. The dominant population in this catalog is that of the hot, hydrogen-atmosphere subdwarfs, the sdB stars, which comprise nearly 40 per cent of the sample. The hot white dwarfs of spectral types DA, DB, and DO account for 21, 2.8, and 1.0 per cent of the sample, respectively, while cooler DC or DZ white dwarfs add another 1.2 per cent. Cataclysmic variables and composite-spectrum binaries account for 5 per cent, although many other spectra dominated by a hot star showed evidence for a cool companion at red wavelengths. Planetary nebulae central stars account for another 0.5 per cent. Extragalactic objects comprise about 9 per cent of the complete sample, with QSOs representing 5.4 per cent. Only 0.3 per cent (6 objects) remain with totally unsatisfactory or unknown spectral classes.

The main goal of this study is to determine a full set of uniform spatial, structural, kinematic, and astrophysical parameters for as many known open clusters as possible. On the basis of stellar data from PPMXL and 2MASS, the authors used a dedicated data-processing pipeline to determine kinematic and photometric membership probabilities for stars in a cluster region. For an input list of 3,784 targets from the literature, they confirm that 3,006 are real objects, the vast majority of them are open clusters, but associations and globular clusters are also present. For each confirmed object, the authors determined the exact position of the cluster center, the apparent size, proper motion, distance, color excess, and age. For about 1,500 clusters, these basic astrophysical parameters have been determined for the first time. For the bulk of the clusters the authors also derived the tidal radii. In addition, they estimated average radial velocities for more than 30% of the confirmed clusters. The present sample (called MWSC) reaches both the central parts of the Milky Way and its outer regions. It is almost complete up to 1.8 kpc from the Sun and also covers the neighboring spiral arms. However, for a small subset of the oldest open clusters (ages more than ~ 1 Gyr), the authors found some evidence of incompleteness within about 1 kpc from the Sun.

Probable stellar members in each target complex are identified using X-ray and/or infrared data via two pathways: (1) X-ray detections of young/massive stars with coronal activity/strong winds or (2) infrared excess (IRE) selection of young stellar objects (YSOs) with circumstellar disks and/or protostellar envelopes. In this particular study, the authors present the methodology for the second pathway using Spitzer/IRAC, 2MASS, and UKIRT imaging and photometry. Although IRE selection of YSOs is well-trodden territory, MYStIX presents unique challenges. The target complexes range from relatively nearby clouds in uncrowded fields located toward the outer Galaxy (e.g., NGC 2264, the Flame Nebula) to more distant, massive complexes situated along complicated, inner Galaxy sightlines (e.g., NGC 6357, M 17). The authors combine IR spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with IR color cuts and spatial clustering analysis to identify IRE sources and to isolate probable YSO members in each MYStIX target field from the myriad types of contaminating sources that can resemble YSOs: extragalactic sources, evolved stars, nebular knots, and even unassociated foreground/background YSOs. Applying their methodology consistently across 18 of the target complexes, they produce the MYStIX IRE Source (MIRES) Catalog comprising 20,719 sources, including 8,686 probable stellar members of the MYStIX target complexes. They also classify the SEDs of 9,365 IR counterparts to MYStIX X-ray sources to assist the first pathway, the identification of X-ray-detected stellar members.

Both spectral analysis and logN - logS distributions of the NuSTAR sources indicate that the X-ray spectra of the NuSTAR sources should have kT &amp;amp;gt; 20 keV on average for a single-temperature thermal plasma model or an average photon index of Gamma = 1.5 - 2 for a power-law model. These findings suggest that the GC X-ray source population may contain a larger fraction of XBs with high plasma temperatures than the field population. The observations of the GC region with NuSTAR began in 2012 July, shortly after its launch. The original survey strategy for the GC region was to match the central 2 degree x 0.7 degree region covered by the Chandra X-ray Observatory (Wang et al. 2002, Nature, 415, 148; Muno et al. 2009, ApJS, 181, 110). The field of views (FOVs) of neighboring NuSTAR observations in the survey were designed to overlap with each other by ~40%. Multiple observations of the same region with relatively large FOV offsets tend to average out the vignetting effects of each observation, enabling a more uniform coverage of the region. Multiple observations are also suitable for monitoring long term X-ray variability of sources in the region. Even when observing a single target, the NuSTAR observation is often broken up into two or more segments with relatively large pointing offsets to allow an efficient subtraction of a detector coordinate-dependent background component (e.g., Mori et al. 2013, ApJ, 770, L23).</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=nugalcen&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/nugalcen.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The resulting images, or plates, give the best estimate from the IRAS survey data of the point source flux density at every surveyed point of the sky. The Faint Source Catalog (FSC) is a compilation of the sources extracted from the FSS plates that have met reasonable reliability requirements. Averaged over the whole catalog, the FSC is at least 98.5% reliable at 12 and 25 microns, and ~94% at 60 microns. For comparison, the IRAS Point Source Catalog (PSC) is &amp;amp;gt;99.997% reliable, but the sensitivity of the FSC exceeds that of the PSC by about a factor of 2.5. This increase in sensitivity results from the co-adding of the three separate hours-confirming (HCON) passes over the sky which were used for confirmation and not added together for the Point Source Catalog. The FSC also contains 99,973 infrared sources which are not in the PSC. The FSC contains data for 173,044 point sources in unconfused regions with flux densities typically above 0.2 Jy at 12, 25, and 60 microns, and above 1.0 Jy at 100 microns.

Although shallow by contemporary standards, in the &amp;amp;quot;classical&amp;amp;quot; 2-10 keV band of X-ray astronomy the XSS provides significantly better sensitivity than any currently available all-sky survey. The authors investigate the source content of the XSS, focusing on detections in the hard 2-10 keV band down to a very low threshold (&amp;amp;gt;= 4 counts net of background). At the faint end, the survey reaches a flux sensitivity of roughly 3 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-12&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg/cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;/s (2-10 keV). The starting point was a sample of 487 sources detected in the XSS (up to and including release XMMSL1d2) at high galactic latitude in the hard band. Through cross-correlation with published source catalogs from surveys spanning the electromagnetic spectrum from radio through to gamma-rays, they find that 45% of the sources have likely identifications with normal/active galaxies. A further 18% are associated with other classes of X-ray object (nearby coronally active stars, accreting binaries, clusters of galaxies), leaving 37% of the XSS sources with no current identification. The authors go on to define an XSS extragalactic sample comprised of 219 galaxies and active galaxies selected in the XSS hard band. They investigate the properties of this extragalactic sample including its X-ray log N - log S distribution, and it is this sample that is contained in this table. The authors find that, in the low-count limit, the XSS is, as expected, strongly affected by Eddington bias. There is also a very strong bias in the XSS against the detection of extended sources, most notably clusters of galaxies. A significant fraction of the detections at and around the low-count limit may be spurious. Nevertheless, it is possible to use the XSS to extract a reasonably robust sample of extragalactic sources, excluding galaxy clusters. The differential log N - log S relation of these extragalactic sources matches very well to the HEAO-1 A2 all-sky survey measurements at bright fluxes and to the 2XMM source counts at the faint end. The substantial sky coverage afforded by the XSS makes this survey a valuable resource for studying X-ray bright source samples, including those selected specifically in the hard 2 - 10 keV band.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=xmmslewegs&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/xmmslewegs.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

These samples are derived using X-ray data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, near-infrared (NIR) photometry from the United Kingdom InfraRed Telescope (UKIRT) and from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), mid-infrared (MIR) photometry from the Spitzer Space Telescope, and from published spectroscopically-identified massive stars.

The authors aim to uncover the population of the central, young star cluster Collinder 69, and in particular to find those diskless Class III pre-main sequence objects which have not been identified by previous surveys based on near- and mid-infrared searches, and to establish the X-ray luminosity function for the association.

The presence of circumstellar disks is discussed using mid-infrared photometry from the Spitzer Space Telescope.

A total of 395 X-ray point sources are detected, 299 of which (76%) have an optical or near-infrared (NIR) counterpart identified from deep FLAMINGOS images. From X-ray and mass sensitivity limits, the authors infer a total population of ~1700 young stars in the survey region. Based on smoothed stellar surface density maps, they investigate the spatial distribution of the X-ray sources and define three distinctive structures and substructures within them. Structures B and C are associated with previously known embedded IR clusters, while structure A is a new X-ray-identified unobscured cluster. A high-mass protostar RMCX 89 = IRAS 06306+0437 and its associated sparse cluster are studied. The different subregions are not coeval but do not show a simple spatial-age pattern. Disk fractions vary between subregions and are generally &amp;amp;lt;~ 20% of the total stellar population inferred from the X-ray survey. The data are consistent with speculations that triggered star formation around the H II region is present in the RMC, but do not support a simple sequential triggering process through the cloud interior. While a significant fraction of young stars are located in a distributed population throughout the RMC region, it is not clear if they originated in clustered environments.

In addition to bright diffuse emission, they resolved 165 discrete sources, most of which are presumably low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). As found in previous studies, the luminosity function of the resolved sources is well-fitted by a broken power law. In NGC 4697 and NGC 1553, the break luminosity was comparable to the Eddington luminosity of a 1.4 solar mass neutron star. One possible interpretation of this result is that those sources with luminosities above the break are accreting black holes and those below are mainly accreting neutron stars. The total X-ray spectrum of the resolved sources is well fitted by a hard power law. NGC 4649 was observed on 2000 April 20 on the ACIS-S3 CCD operated at a temperature of -120 C and with a frame time of 3.2 s. In addition to the S3 chip, the ACIS chips I2, I3, S1, S2, and S4 were also turned on for the duration of the observation. Although a number of serendipitous sources were seen on the other chips, the analysis of NGC 4649 in this paper was based on data from the S3 chip alone. The total exposure for the S3 chip was 36,780 s. The discrete X-ray source population on the ACIS S3 image was determined using a wavelet detection algorithm in the 0.3 - 10.0 keV band, and they were confirmed with a local cell detection method. The authors used the CIAO, WAVDETECT, and CELLDETECT programs. The high spatial resolution of Chandra implies that the sensitivity to point sources is not affected very strongly by the background. Thus, the source detection was done using the entire exposure of 36,780 s, including periods with background flares. The wavelet source detection significance threshold was set at 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-6&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, which implies that less than 1 false source (due to a statistical fluctuation in the background) would be detected in the entire S3 image. This significance threshold approximately corresponds to requiring that the source flux be determined to better than 3 sigma.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=ngc4649cxo&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/ngc4649cxo.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The resulting 1.4-GHz map has a synthesized beam size of ~1.7&amp;amp;quot; and an rms noise level of ~3.9 microJansky per beam (&amp;amp;micro;Jy/beam) near its center and ~8 &amp;amp;micro;Jy/beam at 15 arcminutes from phase center. The authors have cataloged 1230 discrete radio emitters, within a 40&apos; x 40&apos; region, above a 5-sigma detection threshold of ~20 uJy at the field center. New techniques, pioneered by Owen &amp;amp;amp; Morrison (2008, AJ, 136, 1889), have enabled the authors to achieve a dynamic range of 6800:1 in a field that has significantly strong confusing sources. The authors compare the 1.4-GHz (20-cm) source counts with those from other published radio surveys. Their differential counts are nearly Euclidean below 100 uJy with a median source diameter of ~1.2&amp;amp;quot;. This adds to the evidence presented by Owen &amp;amp;amp; Morrison that the natural confusion limit may lie near 1 uJy. If the Euclidean slope of the counts continues down to the natural confusion limit as an extrapolation of their log N-log S, this indicates that the cutoff must be fairly sharp below 1 uJy, else the cosmic microwave background temperature would increase above 2.7K at 1.4GHz.

The authors detected a total of 146 sources, 29 of which are young stellar objects (YSOs), 2 of which are BV stars, and 5 more of which are associated with phenomena related to YSOs. Based on their radio variability and spectral index, the authors propose that about 16 of the remaining 110 unclassified sources are also YSOs. For approximately 65% of the known YSOs detected here as radio sources, the emission is most likely non-thermal and related to stellar coronal activity. As also recently observed in Ophiuchus, this sample of YSOs with X-ray counterparts lies below the fiducial Guedel &amp;amp;amp; Benz (1993, ApJ, 405, L63) relation. In the reference paper, the authors analyze the proper motions of nine sources in the W40 region, thus allowing them to better constrain the membership of the radio sources in the region. The Serpens molecular cloud and the Serpens South cluster were observed in the same observing sessions on three different epochs (2011 June 17, July 19, and September 12 UT), using 25 and 4 pointings, respectively, with the JVLA at 4.5 and 4.5GHz. The W40 region, on the other hand, was only observed on two epochs (2011 June 17 and July 16), using 13 pointings. The details of the observations are listed in Table 1 of the reference paper. The authors adopted the same criteria as Dzib et al. (2013, ApJ, 775, 63) to consider a detection as firm. For new sources, i.e., those without reported counterparts in the literature, they considered 5-sigma detections, where sigma is the rms noise of the area around the source. For known sources with counterparts in the literature, on the other hand, they included 4-sigma detections. According to these criteria, they detected 94 sources in the Serpens molecular cloud, 41 in the W40 region, and 8 in the Serpens South cluster, for a total of 143 detections. Out of the 143 sources, 69 are new detections (see Section 3.2 of the reference paper). GBS-VLA source positions were compared with source positions from X-ray, optical, near-IR, mid-IR, and radio catalogs. GBS-VLA sources were considered to have a counterpart at another wavelength when the positional coincidences were better than the combined uncertainties of the two data sets. These were about 1 arcsecond for the IR catalogs. For the X-ray and radio catalogs it depended on the instrument and its configuration. The search was done in SIMBAD and included all the major catalogs. The authors also accessed the lists with all YSOs in the c2d-GB clouds compiled by Dunham et al.(2013, AJ, 145, 94) and L.E. Allen et al. (2015, in preparation). In total, 354 c2d-GB sources lie inside the regions observed by the present survey. In order to find their radio counterparts, the authors imaged regions of 64 pixels in each dimension, centered in the c2d-GB positions, and combining accordingly with each region, the three or two epochs. For this search, they only used the field whose phase center was closest to the source. Three additional radio sources were found in Serpens South in this pursuit, increasing the number of the radio detections to 146.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=vlagbsser&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/vlagbsser.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

While its OB members are well studied, its low-mass population has received little attention. In the reference paper, the authors present high-spatial resolution Chandra ACIS-I X-ray data, wherein they detect 1,613 point X-ray sources. Their main aim was to clarify the global properties of NGC 6231 down to low masses through a detailed membership assessment, and to study the cluster stars&apos; spatial distribution, the origin of their X-ray emission, the cluster age and formation history, and its initial mass function. The authors use X-ray data, complemented by optical and IR data, to establish cluster membership. The spatial distribution of different stellar subgroups also provides highly significant constraints on cluster membership, as does the distribution of X-ray hardness. In their study, the authors perform spectral modeling of group-stacked X-ray source spectra. The X-ray properties of the sources detected in the Chandra observations of NGC 6231, and their cross-identifications in the catalogs of Sung, Sana, and Bessell (2013 AJ, 145, 37; hereafter SSB); VPHAS+ (Drew et al., 2014, MNRAS, 440, 2036); and 2MASS (CDS Cat. II/246), and information about membership, H-alpha or IR excess, mass and luminosity are also provided. SSB derive a distance modulus for NGC 6231 of 11.0 (1,585 pc), a reddening E(B - V) = 0.47, and a nearly normal reddening law with R = 3.2. The present authors adopt these values for this work. NGC 6231 was observed twice in X-rays with the ACIS-I detector on-board the Chandra X-ray Observatory on 2005, July 3 to 4 (ObsId 5372) and 16 to 17 (ObsID 6291), respectively. The two pointings share the same center (aimpoint) but were performed with a different roll angle. Effective exposure times for the observations were 76.19 and 44.39 ks, respectively, making the total exposure time 120.58 ks. The data were filtered to retain the energy band 0.3 - 8.0 keV, and the full-field lightcurves were inspected to search for high-background periods, but none were found. Exposure maps were computed using standard CIAO software tasks. To these prepared datasets, the authors applied the source detection software PWDetect, a wavelet-based detection algorithm developed at INAF-Osservatorio Astronomico di Palermo. The PWDetect version used here is a modified one, able to detect sources in combined datasets, thus taking full advantage of the deep total exposure. The detection threshold was chosen such as to yield ten spurious detections in the field of view (FOV), for the given background counts. This is a more relaxed constraint than the more usual limit of one spurious detection per field, but is justified when the lowered threshold allows the detection of more than one hundred additional faint sources, as it was the case here or in the COUP Program&apos;s Orion data. This HEASARC table contains the list of 1,613 detected X-ray point sources and information about their optical and IR counterparts, where known.

This is one of the largest X-ray-selected cluster samples, comparable in size only to the ROSAT All-Sky Survey sample of nearby clusters (Ebeling et al. 1997). Clusters in the inner 17.&apos;5 of the ROSAT PSPC field of view are detected using the spatial extent of their X-ray emission. Fluxes of detected clusters range from 1.6 x 10^-14 to 8 x 10^-12 ergs s^-1 cm^-2 in the 0.5-2 keV energy band. X-ray luminosities range from 10^42 ergs s^-1, corresponding to very poor groups, to ~5 x 10^44 ergs s^-1, corresponding to rich clusters. The cluster redshifts range from z = 0.015 to z &amp;amp;gt; 0.5. The catalog lists X-ray fluxes, core radii, and spectroscopic redshifts for 73 clusters and photometric redshifts for the remainder. Of 223 X-ray sources, 203 have been optically confirmed as clusters of galaxies. Of the remaining 20 sources, 19 are likely false detections arising from blends of unresolved point X-ray sources. Optical identifications of the remaining object are hampered by a nearby bright star. Above a flux of 2 x 10^-13 ergs s^-1 cm^-2, 98% of extended X-ray sources are optically confirmed clusters. The number of false detections and their flux distribution are in perfect agreement with simulations. The log N-log S relation for clusters derived from this catalog shows excellent agreement with counts of bright clusters derived from the Einstein Extended Medium Sensitivity Survey and the ROSAT All-Sky Survey. At fainter fluxes, its log N-log S relation agrees with the smaller area WARPS survey. The cluster counts appear to be systematically higher than those from a 50 square degree survey by Rosati et al.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=rosgalclus&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/rosgalclus.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The fields covered by the X-ray images contain over 1500 catalogued stars in a roughly 0.8 square degree region centered on the Trapezium. In all, 389 distinct X-ray sources were detected, at least two-thirds of which were associated with a single proper-motion cluster member. X-ray emission was detected from stars of all spectral types, from the massive O- and B-type components of the Trapezium to the coolest, low-mass pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars. In the research paper in which these data were presented (Gagne et al. 1995), the authors focussed primarily on X-ray emission from the late-type PMS stars. Of the ~100 late-type cluster members with measured spectral types, approximately three-fourths were detected; the authors derived X-ray luminosity upper limits for the remaining stars. They found that coronal X-ray emission appeared to turn on at around a spectral type of F6, with the upper envelope of activity increasing with decreasing effective temperature. The current database is a representation of Table 6 from Gagne et al. (1995) (notice that the data given in Tables 2 and 3 of this reference is included in the HEASARC database ORIONXRAY, q.v.) which lists X-ray and other data for 175 Orion stars for which spectral types, spectroscopic rotational velocities, and/or spot-modulated photometric rotational periods are available. The X-ray data (either detections or upper limits) are given in the form of X-ray luminosities log Lx and X-ray to bolometric luminosity ratios (log Lx/Lbol). The conversion factor from HRI counts to log Lx was derived for each star based on (i) an assumed 1 keV Raymond and Smith thermal spectrum, (ii) a distance of 440 pc, and (iii) a column density of 2 x 10^21 cm^(-2) per magnitude of visual extinction A(V), where accurate A(V) values are used when available, or otherwise a moderate absorption of 0.25 magnitudes is assumed. Notice that, for stars not identified as candidate optical counterparts in Tables 2 and 3 of Gagne et al. (the HEASARC database ORIONXRAY), the derived upper limit to the X-ray luminosity usually corresponds to the 3 sigma upper limit to the observed count rate. For a handful of stars in the Trapezium region where a star was eliminated as a candidate optical counterpart, despite being within the source search circle, because a more likely counterpart had a smaller position offset, the upper limit corresponds to either half the observed X-ray source count rate or to 3 sigma, whichever is the highest.

They identify 20 sources with proper-motion cluster members, which are a mix of cataclysmic variables (CVs), active binaries (ABs), and binaries containing sub-subgiants. With follow-up optical spectroscopy, the authors confirm the nature of one CV. They also discover one new, X-ray variable candidate CV with Balmer and He II emission lines in its optical spectrum; this is the first X-ray-selected CV in an open cluster. The number of CVs per unit mass is consistent with the field, suggesting that the 3-4 CVs observed in NGC 6791 are primordial. The authors compare the X-ray properties of NGC 6791 with those of a few old open clusters (NGC 6819, M67) and globular clusters (47 Tuc, NGC 6397). It is puzzling that the number of ABs brighter than 1 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;30&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg/s normalized by cluster mass is lower in NGC 6791 than in M 67 by a factor ~3-7. CVs, ABs, and sub-subgiants brighter than 1 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;30&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg/s are under-represented per unit mass in the globular clusters compared to the oldest open clusters, and this accounts for the lower total X-ray luminosity per unit mass of the former. This indicates that the net effect of dynamical encounters may be the destruction of even some of the hardest (i.e., X-ray-emitting) binaries. The authors observed NGC 6791 with the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) on Chandra from 2004 July 1 20:51 UTC until July 2 10:49 UTC for a total exposure time of 48.2ks (ObsID 4510). They obtained low-resolution spectra of candidate optical counterparts to guide the classification of the X-ray sources. A total of 16 candidate counterparts brighter than V ~18.3 were observed with the FAST long-slit spectrograph on the 1.5m Tillinghast telescope on Mt. Hopkins on nine nights between 2005 June 7 to September 2 (coverage from 3480 to 7400 Angstrom and a 3 Angstrom resolution). Candidate optical counterparts fainter than V ~17 were observed with the fiber-fed multi-object spectrograph Hectospec on the 6.5m Multi-Mirror Telescope. A total of 16 candidate counterparts were observed on the nights of 2005 May 13 and July 4-6 (spectra that cover 3700 to 9150 Angstrom with a 6-Angstrom resolution). The authors performed source detections in broad (0.3-7.0 keV), soft (0.3-2.0 keV) and hard (2.0-7.0 keV) energy bands, also used in their Chandra study of M 67 (van den Berg et al. 2004, A&amp;amp;amp;A, 418. 509), so as to facilitate comparison. The CIAO detection routine wavdetect was run for scales of 1.0 to 11.3 pixels, in steps increasing by a factor of sqrt(2), with the larger scales appropriate for large off-axis angles where the point-spread function (PSF) becomes significantly broader. The authors computed exposure maps for the response at 1 keV to account for spatial variations of the sensitivity. The wavdetect detection threshold was set to 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-6&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, from which the authors expect two spurious detections per detection scale (so 16 spurious detections in total) in the area that they consider here. Combination of the broad, soft, and hard-band source lists results in a master catalog of 86 distinct sources within 8 arcmin of the cluster center, of which 59 lie inside the half-mass radius r&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;h&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;. To investigate the validity of the sources, the authors also ran wavdetect with a threshold of 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-7&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; or an expected number of spurious sources of 1.6.

A comparison with the results of the Einstein M 31 survey reveals 491 newly detected sources, 11 long-term variable sources, and 7 possible transient sources. Comparing the two ROSAT surveys, Supper et al. come up with 34 long-term variable sources and 8 transient candidates. For the M 31 sources, the observed X-ray luminosities range from 4 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;35&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; to 4 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;38&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;.

A study of the spatial distribution and the luminosity function of the X-ray sources shows that the distribution of primordial LMXBs is consistent with the distribution of the K-band light and that their luminosity function flattens below ~10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;37&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; to the dN/dL ~ L&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; law in agreement with the behavior found earlier for LMXBs in the Milky Way and in Cen A. Within a radius of 12 arcminutes, the luminosity function is independent of distance to the center of M 31, in contrast to earlier Chandra studies. The LMXBs located in globular clusters and within ~1 arcminute from the center of M 31 are presumably created via dynamical interactions. The dynamical origin of the r &amp;amp;lt; 1 arcminute sources is strongly suggested by their radial distribution which follows the rho&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;*&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; profile rather than the K-band light distribution.

The authors have combined unique objects found with this method to that of previous work to produce 8,479 K &amp;amp;lt; 9th magnitude M dwarfs.

The PPMXL catalog (Roeser et al. 2010) represents a combination of the USNO-B1.0 and Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) catalogs mapped on to the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF), which allows proper motions to be described in a quasi-absolute manner as opposed to relative. PPMXL now provides low uncertainties for both the proper motion and position for many of the objects within the two catalogs. Typical uncertainties for proper motions are 4 - 10 mas/yr. The NIR JHK magnitudes from 2MASS and the optical BVRI magnitudes from USNO-B1.0 also provide very useful color information about the objects and are used during the sample selection process.

The most likely optical/infrared counterpart of each X-ray source was identified using the chance coincidence probability in the R and IRAC 3.6 micron bands.This method was complemented by the precise positions obtained through Chandra observations. The authors were able to associate a counterpart to each X-ray source in the catalogue. Approximately 94% of them are detected in the R band, while the remaining are blank fields in the optical down to R ~ 24.5, but have a near-infrared counterpart detected by IRAC within 6 arcsec of the XMM-Newton centroid. The multi-band catalog, produced using the positions of the identified optical counterparts, contains photometry in ten photometric bands, from B to the MIPS 24 micron band. The spectroscopic follow-up allowed us to determine the redshift and classification for 237 sources (~ 50% of the sample) brighter than R = 24. The spectroscopic redshifts were complemented by reliable photometric redshifts for 68 sources. The authors classified 47% of the sources with spectroscopic redshift as broad-line active galactic nuclei (BL AGNs) with z = 0.1-3.5, while sources without broad-lines (NOT BL AGNs) are about 46% of the spectroscopic sample and are found up to z = 2.6. The remaining fraction is represented by extended X-ray sources and stars. The authors spectroscopically identified 11 type 2 QSOs among the sources with F(2-10 keV)/F(R) &amp;amp;gt; 8, with redshift between 0.9 and 2.6, high 2-10 keV luminosity (log L(2-10 keV) &amp;amp;gt;= 43.8 erg/s) and hard X-ray colors suggesting large absorbing columns at the rest frame (log N&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;H&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; up to 23.6 cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;). BL AGNs show on average blue optical-to-near-infrared colors, softer X-ray colors and X-ray-to-optical colors typical of optically selected AGNs. Conversely, narrow-line sources show redder optical colors, harder X-ray flux ratio and span a wider range of X-ray-to-optical colors. On average the Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) of high-luminosity BL AGNs resemble the power-law typical of unobscured AGNs. The SEDs of NOT BLAGNs are dominated by the galaxy emission in the optical/near-infrared, and show a rise in the mid-infrared which suggests the presence of an obscured active nucleus. The authors have used the infrared-to-optical colors and near-infrared SEDs to infer the properties of the AGN host galaxies. Identifications and photometric parameters for 478 sources detected by XMM-Newton in the ELAIS-S1 field are given.

Thirty-nine objects in the catalog are new sources, while 311 were already detected in a previous analysis of most of the same data using combined images. The authors present improved positions of these sources, ans also systematically searched for flux variability on time scales of hours to months or years. The detected variability was then used to classify 8 new X-ray binary candidates in M 33. Together with the hardness ratio method and cross-correlation with optical, infrared, and radio data, the authors also classified or confirmed previous classification of 25 supernova remnants and candidates, 2 X-ray binaries, and 11 super-soft source candidates (7 of which are new SSS candidates). In addition, they classified 13 active galactic nuclei and background galaxies, 6 stars, and 23 foreground star candidates in the direction of M 33. A further 206 objects are classified as &apos;hard&apos;, approximately half of which are sources intrinsic to M 33. The relative contribution of the classified XRB and SSS in M 33 is now comparable to M 31. The luminosity distribution of SNRs in both spiral galaxies is almost the same, although the number of the detected SNRs in M 33 remains much higher.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=m33xmm2&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/m33xmm2.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

By including previous catalogs, this work increases the total number of X-ray sources detected in the 4 Ms CDFS, CANDELS area to 793, which represents the largest sample of extremely faint X-ray sources assembled to date. These results suggest that a large fraction of the optical counterparts of our X-ray sources determined by likelihood ratio actually coincides with the priors used for the source detection. Most of the newly detected sources are likely star-forming galaxies or faint absorbed AGN. The authors identified a few sources with putative photometric redshift z &amp;amp;gt; 4.

The optical and infrared photometry for the stars identified as X-ray sources are consistent with most of these objects being pre-main-sequence stars with ages younger than 10 Myr. The two flanking fields in Orion were observed with the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) detector on board the Chandra X-Ray Observatory.

The fields covered by the X-ray images contain over 1500 catalogued stars in a roughly 0.8 square degree region centered on the Trapezium. In all, 389 distinct X-ray sources were detected, at least two-thirds of which were associated with a single proper-motion cluster member. X-ray emission was detected from stars of all spectral types, from the massive O- and B-type components of the Trapezium to the coolest, low-mass pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars. In the research paper in which these data were presented (Gagne et al. 1995), the authors focussed primarily on X-ray emission from the late-type PMS stars. Of the ~100 late-type cluster members with measured spectral types, approximately three-fourths were detected; the authors derived X-ray luminosity upper limits for the remaining stars. They found that coronal X-ray emission appeared to turn on at around a spectral type of F6, with the upper envelope of activity increasing with decreasing effective temperature. The current database is a concatenation of Tables 2 and 3 from Gagne et al. (1995) which list the 389 distinct X-ray sources and their candidate optical counterparts. A detection criterion of 3 sigma was used, i.e., a sigal-to-noise ratio criterion of 3. 324 of the X-ray sources have a single candidate optical counterpart, 50 of the X-ray sources (listed in Table 3 of the original paper) have multiple candidates for the optical counterparts, and the remainder have no optical counterparts.

They developed a calibration and imaging pipeline for the MWA-32T, and used it to produce ~15 arcminutes angular resolution maps of the two fields in the 110-200 MHz band. The authors perform a blind source extraction using these confusion-limited images, and detect 655 sources at high significance with an additional 871 lower significance source candidates. They compare these sources with existing low-frequency radio surveys in their paper in order to assess the MWA-32T system performance, wide-field analysis algorithms, and catalog quality. Their source catalog is found to agree well with existing low-frequency surveys in these regions of the sky and with statistical distributions of point sources derived from Northern Hemisphere surveys; it represents one of the deepest surveys to date of this sky field in the 110-200 MHz band. Observations were conducted with the MWA-32T in 2010 March during a two-week campaign (X13). Data were taken in three 30.72 MHz sub-bands centered at 123.52 MHz, 154.24 MHz, and 184.96 MHz in order to give (nearly) continuous frequency coverage between ~ 110 MHz and ~ 200 MHz. The observing time was divided between two fields.

Compared to the 2FGL catalog, the 3FGL catalog incorporates twice as much data as well as a number of analysis improvements, including improved calibrations at the event reconstruction level, an updated model for Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission, a refined procedure for source detection, and improved methods for associating LAT sources with potential counterparts at other wavelengths. Sources were detected and characterized in the 100 MeV to 300 GeV range. Source detection was based on a threshold likelihood Test Statistic of 25, corresponding to a significance of just over 4 sigma. This catalog includes source location regions, defined in terms of elliptical fits to the 95% confidence regions and spectral fits with three different spectral forms; power-law for most sources, log-parabola for significantly curved sources, and power-law with exponential cutoff for known gamma-ray pulsars. It also includes flux measurements in 5 bands for each source. The Fermi LAT Team has evaluated the populations of gamma-ray sources that are represented in the catalog using a protocol defined before launch. Individual LAT-detected sources have been provided identifications or plausible associations with sources in other astronomical catalogs. Care was taken to characterize the sensitivity of the results to the model of interstellar diffuse gamma-ray emission used to model the bright foreground, and a number of sources at low Galactic latitudes and toward bright local interstellar clouds are flagged as having positions that are strongly dependent on the model or as potentially entirely due to incorrectly modeled structure in the Galactic diffuse emission.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=fermilpsc&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/fermilpsc.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The authors also searched for X-ray sources in the vicinity of the Fornax globular clusters GC 3 and GC 4 and found two sources probably associated with the respective clusters.

In the case of Fornax, this search is extremely difficult since the galaxy centroid of gravity is poorly constrained because of the large asymmetry observed in the optical surface brightness. Since the authors cannot firmly establish the existence of an X-ray counterpart of the putative black hole, they put constraints only on the accretion parameters.

In this present study, the X-ray analysis for Chandra ACIS-I observations of 10 of the MYStIX fields is described, and a catalog of &amp;amp;gt; 10,000 X-ray sources is presented in this table. In comparison to other published Chandra source lists for the same regions, the number of MYStIX-detected faint X-ray sources in a region is often doubled. While the higher catalog sensitivity increases the chance of false detections, it also increases the number of matches to infrared stars. X-ray emitting contaminants include foreground stars, background stars, and extragalactic sources. The X-ray properties of sources in these classes are discussed in the reference paper. The X-ray observations were made with the imaging array on the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS-I) on board the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. This array of four CCD detectors subtends 17&apos; x 17&apos; on the sky. The number of different Chandra pointings for each region, the total exposures for these pointings, and details of how the observations were taken are provided in Table 1 of the reference paper. Overall, 29 Chandra ObsIDs are included with typical integration times for a pointing of 40 - 100 ks, sufficient to detect most OB stars and lower-mass pre-main-sequence stars down to ~ 0.5 - 1 solar masses for the MYStIX regions. The 10 MYStIX MSFRs treated herein are listed in Table 2 of the reference paper. The data were acquired from the Chandra Data Archive from 2001 Jan to Mar 2008 for 10 MYStIX fields (the Flame Nebula, RCW 36, NGC 2264, the Rosette Nebula, the Lagoon Nebula, NGC 2362, DR 21, RCW 38, Trifid Nebula and NGC 1893). The X-ray photometry is from Broos et al. (2010, ApJ, 714, 1582; ACIS Extract); see also the CCCP, Broos et al. (2011, ApJS, 194, 2). The source significance quantities (fb_prob_no_src, sb_prob_no_src, hb_prob_no_src and prob_no_src_min) are computed using a subset of each source&apos;s extractions chosen to maximize significance (Broos et al. 2010, ApJ, 714, 1582, Section 6.2). The source position and positional uncertainty quantities are computed using a subset of each source&apos;s extractions chosen to minimize the position uncertainty (Broos et al. 2010, ApJ, 714, 1582, Sections 6.2 and 7.1). All other quantities are computed using a subset of each source&apos;s extractions chosen to balance the conflicting goals of minimizing photometric uncertainty and of avoiding photometric bias (Broos et al. 2010, ApJ, 714, 1582, Sections 6.2 and 7). The observed and absorption-corrected energy fluxes and their associated errors and the estimated hydrogen column densities and their uncertainties are derived using non-parametric procedures (XPHOT, Getman et al. 2010, ApJ, 708, 1760). XPHOT assumes the X-ray spectral shapes of young, low-mass stars, which come from coronal X-ray emission. XPHOT quantities will therefore be unreliable for high-mass stars, for which X-ray emission is associated with the stellar wind.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=mystixxray&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/mystixxray.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

Two main results are obtained. First, the best census to date for the stellar population of the region has been made, with many members of two rich stellar clusters, the lightly obscured Cep OB3b association and the deeply embedded cluster in Cep B, whose existence was previously traced only by a handful of radio sources and T Tauri stars, being identified. Second, a discrepancy between the X-ray luminosity functions of the Cep OB3b and the Orion Nebula cluster has been found. This may be due to the different initial mass functions of the two regions (an excess of ~=0.3 M_solar stars) or different age distributions. Several other results are obtained. A diffuse X-ray component seen in the field is attributed to the integrated emission of unresolved low-mass PMS stars. The X-ray emission from HD 217086 (O7n), the principle ionizing source of the region, follows the standard model, involving many small shocks in an unmagnetized radiatively accelerated wind. X-ray source 294 joins a number of similar superflare PMS stars for which long magnetic structures may connect the protoplanetary disk to the stellar surface.

The catalog is count-rate limited at 0.05 ct s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; in the X-ray and covers the area of sky with Declination &amp;amp;lt; 0 degrees and |b| &amp;amp;gt; 10 degrees. The RASS-6dFGS sample was one of the additional target catalogs of the 6dFGS and as a result the authors obtained optical spectra for 2224 (65 per cent) RASS sources. Of these, 1715 (77%) have reliable redshifts with a median redshift of z = 0.16 (excluding the Galactic sources). For the optically bright sources (b_J &amp;amp;lt;= 17.5) in the observed sample, over 90% have reliable redshifts. The catalog mainly comprises quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) and active galaxies but also includes 238 Galactic sources. Of the sources with reliable redshifts, the majority are type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGN, 69%), while 12% are type 2 AGN, 6% absorption-line galaxies and 13% are stars. The authors also identify a small number of optically faint, very low redshift, compact objects which fall outside the general trend in the b_J - z plane. The RASS-6dFGS catalog complements a number of Northern hemisphere samples, particularly the ROSAT Bright Source Catalogue-NRAO VLA Sky Survey (RBSC-NVSS) sample (Bauer et al. 2000, ApJS, 129, 547), and furthermore, in the same region of sky (-40 degrees &amp;amp;lt; Declination &amp;amp;lt; 0 degrees) reveals an additional 561 sources that were not identified as part of that sample. The authors detect 918 sources (27%) of the RASS-6dFGS sample in the radio using either the 1.4 GHz NVSS or the 843 MHz Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey (SUMSS) catalogues and find that the detection rate changes with redshift. At redshifts larger than 1 virtually all of these sources have radio counterparts and with a median flux density of 1.15 Jy, they are much stronger than the median flux density of 28.6 mJy for the full sample. The authors attribute this to the fact that the X-ray flux of these objects is being boosted by a jet component, possibly Doppler boosted, that is only present in radio-loud AGN. The RASS-6dFGS sample provides a large set of homogeneous optical spectra ideal for future studies of X-ray emitting AGN.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=rass6dfgs&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/rass6dfgs.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

They included in the catalog the sources with an edge-darkened radio morphology, redshift &amp;amp;lt;= 0.15, and extending (at the sensitivity of the FIRST images) to a radius r larger than 30 kpc from the center of the host. The authors also selected an additional sample (sFRICAT) of 14 smaller (10 &amp;amp;lt; r &amp;amp;lt; 30 kpc) FR Is, limiting to z &amp;amp;lt; 0.05. The hosts of the FRICAT sources are all luminous (-21 &amp;amp;gt;~ M&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;r&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt;~ 24), red early-type galaxies with black hole masses in the range 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;8&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;~ M&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;BH&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;~ 3 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;9&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; solar masses); the spectroscopic classification based on the optical emission line ratios indicates that they are all low excitation galaxies. Sources in the FRICAT are then indistinguishable from the FR Is belonging to the Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources (3C) on the basis of their optical properties. Conversely, while the 3C-FR Is show a strong positive trend between radio and [O III] emission line luminosity, these two quantities are unrelated in the FRICAT sources; at a given line luminosity, they show radio luminosities spanning about two orders of magnitude and extending to much lower ratios between radio and line power than 3C-FR Is. The authors&apos; main conclusion is that the 3C-FR Is represent just the tip of the iceberg of a much larger and diverse population of FR Is.

The list was cross-correlated with the ROSAT Position Sensitive Proportional Counter (PSPC) LMC source catalogue of Haberl and Pietsch (1999, A&amp;amp;amp;AS, 139, 277; the HEASARC database LMCROSXRAY) in order to obtain the (PSPC) hardness ratios for the X-ray sources detected by both instruments. 138 HRI sources are contained in the PSPC Catalogue, while 259 sources are new detections. The spatial resolution of the HRI being better than that of the PSPC, source positions could be determined with errors smaller than 15 arcsec which are dominated by systematic errors. After cross-correlating the source catalogue with the SIMBAD database and the Tycho Catalogue, 94 HRI sources were identified with known objects based on their positional coincidences and X-ray properties. Whenever more accurate coordinates were given in catalogues or the literature, the X-ray coordinates were corrected and the systematic error of the X-ray position was reduced. For other sources observed simultaneously with an identified source, the positional coordinates were also improved. In total, the X-ray positions of 254 sources were newly determined. The sources identified in this study include 39 foreground stars, 24 supernova remnants (SNR), 5 supersoft sources, 9 X-ray binaries, and 9 active galactic nuclei (AGN) well-known from the literature. Another 8 sources were identified with known candidates for these source classes. An additional 21 HRI sources were suggested by the authors as candidates for SNR, X-ray binaries in the LMC, or background AGN, because of their spatial extents, hardness ratios, X-ray to optical flux ratios, or flux variability.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=lmchrixray&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/lmchrixray.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

It combines the two catalogs for PPM North and PPM South, the Bright Stars Supplement to PPM, and the 90,000 Stars Supplement to the PPM. The PPM North list gives positions and proper motions of 181731 stars north of -2.5 degrees declination. PPM South gives positions and proper motions of 197179 stars south of about -2.5 degrees declination. The star density of PPM South is slightly higher than that of its northern counterpart and the accuracy of the present-epoch positions is roughly twice that in the north. A number of bright stars are missing from the PPM and PPM South Star Catalogs. The Bright Stars Supplement included here makes the PPM catalogs complete down to V=7.5 mag. For this purpose it adds all missing stars brighter than V=7.6 mag that could be found in published star lists. Their total number is 321. Only 5 of them are brighter than V=3.5 Since its appearance in 1966, the SAO Catalogue has been the primary source for stellar positions and proper motions. Typical values for the rms errors are 1 arcsec in the positions at epoch 1990, and 1.5 arcsec/century in the proper motions. The corresponding figures for the AGK3 Catalog in the northern hemisphere are 0.45 arcsec and 0.9 arcsec/century. Common to both of these catalogues is the fact that proper motions are derived from two observational epochs only, and that positions are nominally in the B1950/FK4 coordinate system. The PPM Star Catalogue (Roeser and Bastian, 1991, Bastian et al., 1993; for a short description see Roeser and Bastian, 1993) effectively replaced these catalogues by providing more precise astrometric data for more stars on the J2000/FK5 coordinate system. Compared to the SAO Catalogue the improvement in precision is about a factor of 3 on the northern and a factor of 6 to 10 on the southern hemisphere. In addition, the number of stars is increased by about 50 percent. Typical values for the rms errors on the northern hemisphere are 0.27 arcsec in the positions at epoch 1990, and 0.42 arcsec/century in the proper motions. On the southern hemisphere PPM is much better, the corresponding figures being 0.11 arcsec and 0.30 arcsec/century. The improvement over the SAO Catalogue was made possible by the advent of new big catalogues of position measurements and by the inclusion of the century-old Astrographic Catalogue (AC) into the derivation of proper motions. The AC contains roughly four million stars that are not included in PPM. For most of them no precise modern-epoch position measurements exist. Thus it is not yet possible to derive proper motions with PPM quality for all AC stars. But among the 4 million there is a subset of some 100,000 CPC-2 stars that are not included in PPM. These stars constitute the 90,000 Stars Supplement to PPM, and can be identified from their PPM Number having a value between 700001 and 789676.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=ppm&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/ppm.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The SACY sample is defined by Hipparcos (CDS Cat. &amp;amp;lt;I/239&amp;amp;gt;) and Tycho-2 (CDS Cat. &amp;amp;lt;I/259&amp;amp;gt;) stars within an error radius of 2.6 times the positional error of the ROSAT All-Sky Bright Source Catalogue (1RXS, CDS Cat. &amp;amp;lt;IX/10&amp;amp;gt;). The used cut-off (B-V=0.6), corresponding approximately to a G0 dwarf, is near the hottest stars where the strength of the LiI line can be used as an youth indicator. All Hipparcos stars having M_v &amp;amp;lt; 2.0 have been excluded. The northern boundary limits of the survey are given in Table 1 of the reference paper. In addition to the 1511 stars observed at least once, 115 stars with data taken from the literature have been added in order to complement the sample. In addition to these 1626 stars in the SACY sample (sources with source number prefixes of &apos;S&apos;), entries for 165 other observed stars (sources with source number prefixes of &apos;O&apos;) are also included in this table. Most of the spectroscopic observations (~70%) were performed with the FEROS spectrograph at the 1.5m/ESO telescope at La Silla between January 1999 and September 2002 (ON-ESO agreement and ESO program identification 67.C-0123). Two more runs (ESO program identifications 072.C-0393 and 077.C-0138) were carried out at the 2.2m/ESO telescope. Another set of data (~30%) was collected at the coude spectrograph attached to 1.60m telescope at the Observatorio rio do Pico dos Dias (OPD), LNA, Brazil. Some spectra are a re-analysis of the ones taken for the PDS program. A few observations were collected using the CORALIE attached to the Swiss Euler Telescope at La Silla. UBV(RI)c photometry for part of the sample was obtained using FOTRAP at the 0.60m Zeiss telescope of the OPD. When a star was not observed photometrically by the authors, they tried to obtain some useful photometric data from the Hipparcos and Tycho Catalogues or in the available literature in the SIMBAD. For multiple stars, magnitudes and colors were corrected in order to take into account the presence of the companion(s).</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=sacy&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/sacy.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

       "<tr><td>346</td><td>optical</td><td>MILLIQUAS</td><td>ivo://nasa.heasarc/milliquas</td><td>This table contains the Million Quasars (MILLIQUAS) Catalog, Version 5.2 (5 August 2017). It is a compendium of 607,208 type-I QSOs and AGN, largely complete from the literature up to 5 August 2017, including the release of SDSS-DR14. Also included are ~1,350,000 high-confidence (80%+ likelihood) quasar candidates from the NBCKDE, NBCKDE-v3, XDQSO, AllWISE and Peters photometric quasar catalogs and from all-sky radio/X-ray associated objects which are calculated by the author. Type-II and BL Lac objects are also included, bringing the total count to 1,998,464. Objects have been de-duplicated across multiple source catalogs. Each object is presented with its original name, best redshift, and 0.1-arcsecond-accurate astrometry (sourced from optical APM/USNO-B/SDSS data). Low-confidence or questionable objects (so deemed by their researchers) are not included in Milliquas. Additional quality cuts are applied as detailed in Flesch 2015, PASA, 32, 10. Multiple lensed images are excluded and only the brightest one kept. The aim here is to present one unique reliable object per each data row. This version has the following changes from the previous edition: &amp;amp;lt;pre&amp;amp;gt; (1) SDSS-DR14 and SDSS-DR14Q have been added, using the processing rules from the Half Million Quasars catalog (HMQ: Flesch 2015, PASA, 32, 10). (2) WISE quasar candidates have been added from Secrest et al. 2015, ApJS, 221, 12. These are ~430,000 candidates over the whole sky for which 2-color optical objects were found within a 2-arcsec radius. They have been processed into pQSOs from calibration against the SDSS-DR12Q multi-class superset, and photometric redshifts obtained using the four-color based method from the HMQ Appendix 2. The four colors used were B-R, R-W1, W1-W2, and W2-W3. (3) Type-II narrow emission-line galaxies (NELGs, class=&apos;N&apos;) have been added as the luminosity class corresponding to the type-I AGN galaxies. High-luminosity type-II NLAGN (class=&apos;K&apos;) correspond to the type-I quasars. The NLAGN/NELG divider is the same luminosity/psf function which separates QSOs from AGNs. Type-II NELGs include unquantified contamination by LINERs and probably a few starbursts which eluded removal, so it serves as a catch-all category presented for completeness, rather than as a strict type-II class. (4) Small publications to 5 August 2017 have been added. (5) Positional fixes (of about 2 arcsec) have been applied to ~150 objects. &amp;amp;lt;/pre&amp;amp;gt; The contents are relatively simple; each object is shown as one entry with the sky coordinates, its original name, object class, red and blue optical magnitudes, PSF class, redshift, the citations for the name and redshift, and up to four radio/X-ray identifiers where applicable. Questions/comments/praise/complaints may be directed to Eric Flesch at eric@flesch.org. If you use this catalog in published research, the author requests that you please cite it. The citation for the Milliquas catalog is Flesch E., 2015, PASA, 32, 10, which was the published version of this catalog after the release of SDSS-DR12. This research has made use of the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) which is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Version Log: &amp;amp;lt;pre&amp;amp;gt; 0.1 22Apr09 0.3 6May09 Added a radio identifier and an X-ray identifier. 0.5 11May09 Added 30816 objects from newly calculated associations to XMM, Chandra and SUMSS detections, plus some tweaks. Also added QSO probability % for non-confirmed QSOs. 0.8 22Jun09 Added Chandra Source Catalog 1.0 (2009). 1.0 3Aug09 Extensive de-duplication. XMM Slew Catalog data added. 1.4 20Aug09 Misc fixes in the de-duplications. 1.5 29Aug09 Used XMM Slew Catalog v1.3 2.0 14Jun10 Used XMM Slew Catalog v1.4, XMM3, and XAssist4. 2.1 17Aug10 Removed 8627 NELGs masquerading as AGNe. 2.2 7Jan11 About 10,000 AGNe from the previous edition are now presented as QSOs. 796 AGNe mistakenly expunged in 2.1 have been restored. 2.3 5Mar11 SDSS DR-8 and BOSS targets have been included and the threshold for inclusions of candidates has been raised from 60% to 70%. 2.4 5Jun11 Improved QSO-likelihood calculation for the BOSS targets, so 17% of previously included BOSS targets drop out. Newly included data from several sources (see above). 2.5 20Jul11 Some de-duplication of quasars which were discovered prior to 1990, 200 recent NED quasars added, some radio/X-ray associations to USNO-B optical data added. 2.6 10Sep11 The USNO-B catalog has been added and hard-deduplicated against APM and SDSS data to make a background pool of 1.04 billion optical objects. Also, about 12 million orphaned one-color APM objects have been removed. There are consequently improvements in this catalog&apos;s optical selections and astrometry without changing the net totals much. XMM Slew 1.5 catalog added. Some further astrometric fixes and de-duplications of early quasars. 2.7 5Nov11 New quasar publications to 4 November 2011 were added, and a few fixes on individual objects incorporated. 2.8 29Jan12 Completed the fixes of non-astrometric relic data from the Veron-Cetty &amp;amp;amp; Veron 13th edition. About 150 other fixes. Quasars compilation updated through 27 January 2012. 2.9 2Apr12 Data brought up to publications as of 31 March 2012, about 50 astrometric fixes done, and the new FIRST radio catalog, 12Feb16 version, incorporated. 2.10 6Aug12 Data brought up to publications as of 31 July 2012, including the SDSS-DR9 release, XAssist XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray data updated to 30 June 2012; as this is a catalog for type I (broad-line) objects, 1870 Seyfert-2s, 532 LINERs, and 6 NELGs were removed, but BL Lacs were retained as unconstrained emission objects. 3.0 9Sep12 Data brought up to publications as of 31 August 2012. Redshifts are calculated for the XDQSO photometric quasar candidates. Fixed issues with 30 DEEP2 object. Separated out 15 SDSS-DR9 object that had been conflated with others. QSO-AGN separator restored to that used through v2.9, thus ~5000 QSOs were re-classified as AGNe. AGNe historic names sourced from the Principal Galaxy Catalogue. 3.1 22Oct12 Quasar data brought up to publications as of 20 Oct. 2012, including the new DR9 Quasar catalog (Paris I., 2012, arXiv:1210.5166). 3.2 10Feb13 Quasar data brought up to publications as of 9 Feb. 2013. MMT quasar positions fixed, and made a few small miscellaneous fixes. 3.3 7Apr13 Quasar data brought up to publications as at 6 April 2013. Added 713 new quasars from Palanque-Delabrouille et al. (2013, A&amp;amp;amp;A, 551, A29). Included SWIRE data, consisting of 117 confirmed quasars and &amp;amp;gt;20K photometric quasars from Rowan-Robinson et al. (2013, MNRAS, 428, 1958). Located 8 QSOs that were previously uncertainly located and removed 1 that had no credible candidates. Removed 26 SDSS-DR9 quasars after inspection showed they were only artifacts. Removed 144 questionable quasars from Iovino et al. (1996, A&amp;amp;amp;AS, 119, 265). Removed 8 blazars classified as white dwarfs by the SDSS DR7 WD Cat (2013,ApJS,204,5). Miscellaneous: 4 moves, 2 de-dups, and 4 deletions found after extensive trawling. 3.4 11Jul13 Quasar data brought up to publications as at 11 July 2013. The author&apos;s paper (2013, PASA, 30, 4) marked 9 QSOs as uncertainly located. Of those: (a) Q 0112-27 is finally sited at J011517.2-271223, courtesy Cyril Hazard. (b) Q 0752+617 is moved to J075646.6+613639, r=16.9, b=17.4, as a better fit with its co-published quasar (NOTNI 16, r=16.7, b=17.2). Added 92 new quasars from Cyril Hazard. Q 1409+732 was found to be sited on a plate flaw, and is now moved one arcmin due East to perfect optical fit at J141003.2+725939, r=19.3, b&amp;amp;gt;22. XAssist v4 XMM-Newton &amp;amp;amp; Chandra X-ray data updated to 30-June-2013. 3.5 11Aug13 Quasar data brought up to publications as at 10 August 2013, including SDSS-DR10. Note that the DR10 is an automated catalog, so its object classifications are not as trustworthy as manual classifications. Thus, earlier manual classifications are retained over DR10 classifications. XMM-Newton X-ray data updated to 3XMM-DR4 version (24-July-2013). FIRST radio data updated to 13Jun05 version (05-June-2013). 3.6 23Oct13 Quasar data brought up to publications as at 22 October 2013. Two additional columns of radio/X-ray detections were added. This is so that any radio lobes will always be fully displayed, and extra detections from other source catalogs give a sense of fuller coverage. 158 additional quasars were added from SDSS-DR10. These were flagged as bad astrometry, but they are confirmed by the author&apos;s optical background database. Photometric quasar candidates from surveys other than NBCKDE and XDQSO, e.g., SWIRE, have been dropped because much of their yield are type 2. This includes Palanque-Delabrouille et al. (2011,A&amp;amp;amp;A,530,122), which has been well investigated spectroscopically and its residue thus less likely to be QSOs. X-ray detections from the Champ2 catalog, Kim M. et al, 2007,ApJS,169,401 have been removed. It&apos;s a small catalog which, unlike others, does not present its raw astrometry needed for calculating optical solutions. The Veron quasar catalog v13 (2010 A&amp;amp;amp;A,518A,10) included some objects denoted as non-quasars by their discovery papers, and the following have been removed as a result: (a) 484 emission-line galaxies (ELGs) of z&amp;amp;lt;0.46 from Schneider/Schmidt/Gunn 1994,AJ,107,1245, incorporated as QSOs by VCV13; (b) 55 ELGs of Schneider/Schmidt/Gunn 1999,AJ,117,40; (c) 58 galaxies from 2dF-GRS (Colless M. et al., astro-ph/0306581); and (d) 41 galaxies from La Franca F. et al., 1999,A&amp;amp;amp;AS,140,351. A few positional fixes, de-duplications, and removals of type-2s. 3.7 26Nov13 Quasar data brought up to publications as at 26 November 2013, including the SDSS DR10Q release by Isabelle Paris et al., 2013 arXiv:1311.4870. 318 SDSS &amp;amp;quot;quasars&amp;amp;quot; of auto-redshift&amp;amp;gt;4 which were not subsequently confirmed by visual inspection are removed as bogus (communication Adam Myers). The Veron quasar catalog v13 (2010 A&amp;amp;amp;A,518A,10) flagged some objects as questionable in their &amp;amp;quot;spec&amp;amp;quot; field. These have unclear spectra or are described as &amp;amp;quot;possible&amp;amp;quot; by their discovery papers. 178 of these are removed, and 52 such BL Lacs with redshift&amp;amp;gt;0.5 are re-classed to AGNs. Some positional fixes and de-duplications of individual objects. 3.8 16Feb14 Quasar data brought up to publications as at 15 February 2014. NBCKDE and BOSS quasar likelihoods have been calibrated against the DR10Q (Paris I. et al., 2013 arXiv:1311.4870) classifications. The Swift X-ray Point Source catalog (Evans P.A. et al., 2014,ApJS,210,8) is added to the background data, resulting in 12604 associations. 110 SDSS-DR10 automated survey objects are removed as artifacts. De-duplication of radio/X-ray detections improved. 3.9 30Jun14 Quasar data brought up to publications as at 30 June 2014. The XMM-Newton Slew Survey source catalog release 1.6 was added to X-ray data. The 1SXPS X-ray detections were being dropped; this was fixed and 21268 were included as a result. The Veron-Cetty &amp;amp;amp; Veron Quasar Catalog (VCV) 13th edition (2010,A&amp;amp;amp;A,518,10) was fully mapped into optical; corrections from this were incorporated. 4.0 05Aug14 Quasar data brought up to publications as at 5 August 2014. The threshold for inclusion of QSO candidates was raised to 80% confidence. This resulted in the loss of ~240,000 objects from v3.9, but it improved the confidence of use. XAssist v4 XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray data was updated to 21-July-2014. 98 entries were found to be type II or not quasars, and so removed. The catalog layout was changed to conform better to the NED guide &amp;amp;quot;Best Practices for Data Publication&amp;amp;quot; by Marion Schmitz et al. (v1.2, 2013) in these ways: (a) all citations were changed to original discovery papers and no longer to VCV 13th edition or to NED and discovery citations are now indexed in a separate file; (b) quasar and radio/X-ray names which used to run together have been corrected to adhere to naming standards. 4.1 20Oct14 Quasar data brought up to publications as at 5 October 2014. The input values of RA and DEC used for this table were given in degrees rather than sexagesimal.Type 2 objects were included for the convenience of the users, but completeness of these is only about 95%. The type I objects are believed to be 100% complete from the literature. About 3000 SDSS &amp;amp;quot;quasars&amp;amp;quot; were removed as not quasars. These were auto-objects which were not taken up by the manual Paris files, and which were not given a subclass by the SDSS pipeline -- thus, the lowest quality objects. Another 2000 were reclassified as AGN or type 2 in this catalog. VCV mis-copied the redshifts from 2008 A&amp;amp;amp;A,488,417 -- now fixed. QSOs &amp;amp;amp; AGN re-partitioned by psf class and modified luminosity equation. Miscellaneous tweaks and fixes done when revealed by publication-related analysis. 4.2 06Dec14 Quasar data brought up to publications as at 6 December 2014. SDSS DR10/DR10Q and DR7/DR7Q data were reprocessed, yielding a few more quasars and using the DR10Q redshifts more as the current standard. Further adjustments were made to the luminosity equation separating QSOs from AGN, resulting in about 2000 AGN reclassified as QSOs. 18 new quasars from Dan Weedman, based on his re-analysis of the Weedman 1985 spectra in combination with NBCKDE photometric redshifts for those objects. 4.3 11Jan15 Quasar data brought up to publications as at 10 January 2015, including the newly-released SDSS-DR12 and SDSS-DR12Q (www.sdss.org). Approximately, 800 quasars sourced from the AGES catalog, Kochanek et al. (2012, ApJS, 200, 8). Approximately, 200 extra quasars added in a full round-up from NED and SIMBAD. 4.4 06Feb15 Quasar data brought up to publications as at 25 January 2015. Some reprocessing of the SDSS-DR12 and SDSS-DR12Q data. About 1000 type-1 objects reclassified to type-2. Photometric candidate likelihoods and redshifts were recalibrated using the SDSS-DR12Q quasars as the benchmark. 4.5 10May15 780 new quasars from LAMOST-DR1 (Luo et al. 2015, arXiv:1505.01570) were added. LAMOST-DR1 is a pipeline catalog with much provisional data, so the author selected the best-eligible objects only. LAMOST plans a manual (reliable) QSO catalog later this year. Also, NED/SIMBAD quasar data is included up to 9 May 2015. Citations were greatly simplified, referencing the recently published Half Million Quasars catalog (HMQ: Flesch E., 2015 PASA, 32, 10, arXiv:1502.06303) for smaller legacy citations while still citing large surveys like SDSS and 2QZ. A legend for the citations is given below, and the separate citations file is no longer needed as a result of this. 3XMM-DR5 (Rosen et al., 2015, arXiv:1504.07051) included in X-ray data. Also, high-confidence data from 2XMMi-DR3 is included, as acknowledged in section 8.2 of the Rosen paper (dropped 2XMMi-DR3 data recognized as valid). Minor fixes to optical data resulted in a few more radio/X-ray associations. 4.6 30Nov15 Additional QSO candidates were sourced from the new NBCKDE v3 catalog (Richards G.T. et al., 2015-ApJS-219-39) and a variability and refraction sourced catalog (Peters C.M. et al., 2015-ApJ-811-95). These added about 300,000 new candidates to Milliquas. Note that the NBCKDE v3 catalog uses different selection criteria from its predecessor, and so augments it rather than superseding it. The threshold for inclusion of QSO candidates was raised from 80% QSO-likelihood to 90%, so the catalog should be reliable even for spot checks. NED and SIMBAD listed quasars were included through 30-Nov-2015. 4.7 02Mar16 527 new QSOs were added from recent publications, including 33 new QSOs with z&amp;amp;gt;5 of which 4 have z&amp;amp;gt;6. The UV-Bright Quasar Survey (UVQS, T.R. Monroe et al, arXiv:1602.06255) was included with two mag-14 and 43 mag-15 QSOs plus many brighter AGN. 4.8 22Jun16 The Chandra ACIS source catalog (Wang S. et al.,2016,ApJS, 224,40) was added and new X-ray associations calculated. The 2nd RASS source catalog 2RXS (Boller Th. et al., 2016, A&amp;amp;amp;A,588,103) replaced 1RXS for the most part, with significant differences in places. Radio/X-ray processing was tightened and data recalibrated to improve likelihood reliability, as part of a new radio/X-ray catalog in preparation. 23,727 radio/X-ray associated objects, recently dropped, were restored on the criterion that they are each 80%+ likely to be true quasars. This was done because this information is not found elsewhere. 4.8b 30Jul16 The 3XMM-DR6 X-ray source catalog was added and new X-ray associations calculated. The radio/X-ray data have been reprocessed in line with that of the Million Optical Radio/X-ray (MORX) Associations Catalog (Flesch 2016, PASA, 33, 52). 5.0 19Jun17 The J2000 coordinates now have 1/10th arcsecond precision, and the magnitudes have 1/100th mag precision, either from the original surveys or from the All-Sky Portable (ASP) optical catalog (arXiv:1705.05434). 5414 net QSOs/AGNs were added from recent surveys (listed below), notably AAOz, OzDES, LAMOST DR2, and a reload of AGES. The 3XMM-DR7 and XMMSL2-2.0 Slew X-ray source catalogues were added and new X-ray associations calculated. A few duplicates were removed. Notably, SDSS J131715.46+601533.1 was found to be a duplicate of SBS 1315+605. 5.1 30Jun17 Included full coverage of the Subaru-XMM Deep Field from multiple authors, LAMOST DR3, and other miscellaneous papers. 5.2 05Aug17 See list of changes above. &amp;amp;lt;/pre&amp;amp;gt;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=milliquas&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/milliquas.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

Twenty-one of the sources have L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt; 2 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;39&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; ergs/s (0.3-10.0 keV; assuming they are at the distance of NGC 1600 of 59.98 Mpc), marking them as ultraluminous X-ray point source (ULX) candidates. NGC 1600 may have the largest number of ULX candidates in an early-type galaxy to date; however, cosmic variance in the number of background active galactic nuclei cannot be ruled out. The spectrum and luminosity function (LF) of the resolved sources are more consistent with sources found in other early-type galaxies than with sources found in star-forming regions of galaxies. The source LF and the spectrum of the unresolved emission both indicate that there are a large number of unresolved point sources. The authors propose that these sources are associated with globular clusters (GCs) and that NGC 1600 has a large GC specific frequency. Observations of the GC population in NGC 1600 would be very useful for testing this prediction. NGC 1600 was observed in two intervals on 2002 September 18-19 (ObsID 4283) and 2002 September 20 (ObsID 4371) with live exposures of 26,783 and 26,752 s, respectively. The first observation showed clear evidence of a major background &amp;amp;quot;flare&amp;amp;quot; in the first 20% of the observation. The second observation had some small fluctuations greater than 20% from the mean rate. After these were filtered, observations 4283 and 4371 had flare-free exposure times of 21,562 and 23,616 s, respectively. This table lists all 71 discrete sources detected by wavdetect over the 0.3-6 keV energy range in the combination of the two observations. The first 3 sources (source numbers 1, 2 and 3) are clearly extended according to the authors. The authors expect 11 +/- 2 foreground/background sources to be present based on the source counts in Brandt et al. (2000, AJ, 119, 2349) and Mushotzky et al. (2000, Nature, 404, 459). The authors determined the observed X-ray hardness ratios for the sources, using the same techniques that they have used previously. They define three hardness ratios as H21 = (M-S)/(M+S), H31 = (H-S)/(H+S), and H32 = (H-M)/(H+M), where S,M, and H are the total counts in the soft (0.3-1 keV), medium (1-2 keV) and hard (2-6 keV) respectively. From their previous definitions, they have reduced the hard band from 2-10 to 2-6 keV: since the 6-10 keV range is dominated by background photons for most sources, this should increase the S/N of the hardness ratio techniques. The hardness ratios measure observed counts, which are affected by Galactic absorption and quantum efficiency (QE) degradation in the Chandra ACIS detectors. In order to compare with other galaxies, it is useful to correct the hardness ratios for these two soft X-ray absorption effects. Therefore, the authors have calculated the intrinsic hardness ratios, denoted by a superscript 0, using a correction factor in each band appropriate to the best-fit spectrum of the resolved sources, and these are what are quoted in this table.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=ngc1600cxo&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/ngc1600cxo.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

Here the catalog of X-ray sources detected in these observations is presented, while an overview of the properties of the point-source population is provided in the reference paper. The authors find 298 sources within the D&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;25&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; radii (the apparent major isophotal galactic radii measured at or reduced to the surface brightness level mu&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;B&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; = 25.0 B-mag per square arcsecond) of NGC 5194 and NGC 5195, of which 20% are variable, a dozen are classical transients, and another half dozen are transient-like sources. The typical number of active ultraluminous X-ray sources in any given observation is ~5, and only two of those sources persist in an ultraluminous state over the 12 years of observations. Given reasonable assumptions about the supernova remnant population, the luminosity function is well described by a power law with an index between 1.55 and 1.7, only slightly shallower than that found for populations dominated by high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), which suggests that the binary population in NGC 5194 is also dominated by HMXBs. The luminosity function of NGC 5195 is more consistent with a low-mass X-ray binary dominated population. This deep study of M51 is composed of 107 ks of archival Chandra observations, to which the authors added another 745 ks of observations. The Chandra ObsIDs and parameters of all of the observations used in this study (which span from June 2000 to October 2012) are given in Table 2 of the reference paper. All of the observations were made with the ACIS-S array. The authors used the ACIS Extract software package (AE) to perform the photometry. For each source, AE extracted a source region whose size and shape were based on the local PSF, and a background region whose size and shape were based on the size of the local PSF and the location of nearby sources. Source properties were then calculated in a standard manner. Of particular importance in this analysis is the prob_no_source parameter, which is the probability that one could measure the observed count rate in the absence of a source. The authors took a source to be significant only if this parameter was &amp;amp;lt; 5 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-6&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;. At this probability threshold, one would expect a single spurious source per field, or roughly 1.5 spurious sources within the D&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;25&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; regions.

The authors have performed the first deep X-ray observation of the galaxies NGC 1512 and NGC 1510 with XMM-Newton to gain information on the population of X-ray sources and diffuse emission in this system of interacting galaxies. They have identified and classified the sources detected in the XMM-Newton field of view by means of spectral analysis, hardness-ratios calculated with a Bayesian method, X-ray variability, and cross-correlations with catalogs in optical, infrared, and radio wavelengths. They also made use of archival Swift (X-ray) and Australia Telescope Compact Array (radio) data to better constrain the nature of the sources detected with XMM-Newton. They detected 106 sources in the energy range of 0.2 - 12 keV, out of which 15 are located within the D&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;25&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; regions of NGC 1512 and NGC 1510 and at least six sources coincide with the extended arms. They identified and classified six background objects and six foreground stars. In the reference paper, they discuss the nature of a source within the D&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;25&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ellipse of NGC 1512, whose properties indicate a quasi-stellar object or an intermediate ultra-luminous X-ray source. Taking into account the contribution of low-mass X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei, the number of high-mass X-ray binaries detected within the D&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;25&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; region of NGC 1512 is consistent with the star formation rate obtained in previous works based on radio, infrared optical, and UV wavelengths. The authors detected diffuse X-ray emission from the interior region of NGC 1512 with a plasma temperature of kT = 0.68(0.31-0.87) keV and a 0.3 - 10 keV X-ray luminosity of 1.3E+38erg/s, after correcting for unresolved discrete sources. The galaxy pair NGC 1512/1510 was observed with XMM-Newton (ObsID: 0693160101) between 2012 June 16 (20:31 UTC) and 2012 June 17 (16:24 UTC) in a single, 63-ks exposure observation. The data analysis was performed through the XMM-Newton Science Analysis System (SAS) software (version 12.0.1). The observation was largely contaminated by high background due to proton flares. After rejecting time intervals affected by high background, the net good exposure time was reduced to 26.0 ks for PN, 39.8 ks for the MOS1 and 34.8 ks for the MOS2. For each instrument, the data were divided into five energy bands: &amp;amp;lt;pre&amp;amp;gt; B&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;1&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; : 0.2 - 0.5 keV B&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; : 0.5 - 1.0 keV B&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;3&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; : 1.0 - 2.0 keV B&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;4&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; : 2.0 - 4.5 keV B&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;5&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; : 4.5 - 12.0 keV &amp;amp;lt;/pre&amp;amp;gt; For the PN, data were filtered to include only single events (PATTERN = 0) in the energy band B__1, and single and double events (PATTERN &amp;amp;lt;= 4) for the other energy bands. The authors excluded the energy range 7.2 - 9.2 keV to reduce the background produced by strong fluorescence lines in the outer detector area. For the MOS, single to quadruple events (PATTERN &amp;amp;lt;= 12) were selected. The source detection procedure is described in Section 2.1 of the reference paper. In the final step, the authors adopted a minimum likelihood of L = 6. They removed false detections (artifacts on the detectors or diffuse emission structures) by visual inspection.

Together with identifications of objects not cataloged in USNO A-2 due to their high surface brightness (M31, M32, ...) and optical pairs, they produced a total of 11,803 associations to a probability of P_id &amp;amp;gt; 50%. They also include in this catalog a list of objects in the SIMBAD database within 10&amp;amp;quot; of the USNO A-2 position, as an aid to identification and source classification. This is the first RASS/BSC counterpart catalog which provides a probability of association between each X-ray source and counterpart, quantifying the certainty of each individual association. The catalog is more useful than previous catalogs which either rely on plausibility arguments for association or do not aid in selecting a counterpart between multiple off-band sources in the field. Sources of high probability of association can be separated out, to produce high-quality lists of classes (Seyfert 1/2s, QSOs, RS CVns) desired for targeted study, or for discovering new examples of known classes (or new classes altogether) through the spectroscopic classification of securely identified but unclassified USNO A-2 counterparts. Low P_id associations can be used for statistical studies and follow-on investigation - for example, performing follow-up spectroscopy of the many low-mass stars to search for signatures of coronal emission, or to investigate the relationship between X-ray emission and classes of sources not previously well-studied for their X-ray emissions (such as pulsating variable stars). The authors find that a fraction ~65.8% of RASS/BSC sources have an identifiable optical counterpart, down to the magnitude limit of the USNO A-2 catalog which could be identified by their spatial proximity and high optical brightness.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=rassusnoid&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/rassusnoid.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The mission was led by CNES in association with four French laboratories, and 7 participating countries and agencies (Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Germany, Spain, and the ESA Science Programme). The satellite is composed of a PROTEUS platform (the 3rd in the series), and a unique instrument: a stellar photometer. It was launched on December 27th, 2006 on a Soyuz Rocket, from Baikonour. The mission has lasted almost 6 years (the nominal 3 years duration and a 3 years extension) and has observed more than 160,000 stars. It suddenly stopped sending data on November 2nd, 2012. CoRoT performed Ultra High Precision Photometry of Stars to detect and characterize the variability of their luminosity with two main objectives: (i) the variability of the object itself: oscillations, rotation, magnetic activity, etc.; (ii) variability due to external causes such as bodies in orbit around the star: planets and companion stars. The original scientific objectives were focused on the study of stellar pulsations (asteroseismology) to probe the internal structure of stars, and the detection of small exoplanets through their transit in front of their host star, and the measurement of their sizes. This lead to the introduction of two modes of observations, working simultaneously: - The bright star mode dedicated to very precise seismology of a small sample (171) of bright and nearby stars (these data are presented in the file currently named &amp;amp;quot;Bright_star.dat&amp;amp;quot; in the CDS version at &amp;amp;lt;a href=&quot;ftp://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/cats/B/corot/Bright_star.dat&quot;&amp;amp;gt;ftp://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/cats/B/corot/Bright_star.dat&amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;gt;): these data are not included in this HEASARC table, notice; - The faint star mode, observing a very large number of stars at the same time, to detect transits, which are rare events, as they imply the alignment of the star, the planet and the observer (these data are presented in the file currently named &amp;amp;quot;Faint_star.dat&amp;amp;quot; in the CDS version at &amp;amp;lt;a href=&quot;ftp://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/cats/B/corot/Faint_star.dat&quot;&amp;amp;gt;ftp://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/cats/B/corot/Faint_star.dat&amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;gt;): this HEASARC table is based on this sample.

Completeness tests which account for kinematic (proper motion) bias suggest that this catalog represents ~75% of the estimated ~11,900 M dwarfs with J &amp;amp;lt; 10 expected to populate the entire sky. The catalog is, however, significantly more complete for the northern sky (~90%) than it is for the south (~60%). Stars are identified as cool, red M dwarfs from a combination of optical and infrared color cuts, and are distinguished from background M giants and highly reddened stars using either existing parallax measurements or, if such measurements are lacking, using their location in an optical-to-infrared reduced proper motion diagram. These bright M dwarfs are all prime targets for exoplanet surveys using the Doppler radial velocity or transit methods; the combination of low-mass and bright apparent magnitude should make possible the detection of Earth-size planets on short-period orbits using currently available techniques. Parallax measurements, when available, and photometric distance estimates are provided for all stars, and these place most systems within 60 pc of the Sun. Spectral type estimated from V-J color shows that most of the stars range from K7 to M4, with only a few late M dwarfs, all within 20 pc. Proximity to the Sun also makes these stars good targets for high-resolution exoplanet imaging searches, especially if younger objects can be identified on the basis of X-ray or UV excess. For that purpose, we include X-ray flux from ROSAT and FUV/NUV ultraviolet magnitudes from GALEX for all stars for which a counterpart can be identified in those catalogs.

When combined with previous Chandra observations of a wider area of the strip, AEGIS-X Wide (AEGIS-XW), these provide data to a nominal exposure depth of 800ks in the three central ACIS-I fields, a region of approximately 0.29 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;. This is currently the third deepest X-ray survey in existence; a factor ~2-3 shallower than the Chandra Deep Fields (CDFs), but over an area ~3 times greater than each CDF. This table contains a catalog of 937 point sources detected in the deep Chandra observations, along with identifications of the X-ray sources from deep ground-based, Spitzer, GALEX, and Hubble Space Telescope imaging. Using a likelihood ratio analysis, the authors associate multiband counterparts for 929/937 of their X-ray sources, with an estimated 95% reliability,making the identification completeness approximately 94% in a statistical sense. Reliable spectroscopic redshifts for 353 of the X-ray sources are available predominantly from Keck (DEEP2/3) and MMT Hectospec, so the current spectroscopic completeness is ~38%. For the remainder of the X-ray sources, the authors compute photometric redshifts based on multiband photometry in up to 35 bands from the UV to mid-IR. Particular attention is given to the fact that the vast majority of the X-ray sources are active galactic nuclei and require hybrid templates. The photometric redshifts have a mean accuracy sigma = 0.04 and an outlier fraction of approximately 5%, reaching sigma = 0.03 with less than 4% outliers in the area covered by CANDELS. The new AEGIS-XD Chandra data were taken at three nominal pointing positions, which the authors have designated AEGIS-1, AEGIS-2, and AEGIS-3.

Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) photometry (3-8 micron) is combined with Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) near-IR data to identify young stellar objects (YSOs) by IR-excess emission from their circumstellar material. Chandra X-ray data are used to identify class III pre-main-sequence stars lacking circumstellar material. The authors identify 624 YSOs: 23 class 0/I and 90 flat spectrum (FS) protostars, 437 class II stars, and 74 class III stars. They also identify 29 (27 new) O star candidates over the IRAC field. Seventy-two stars exhibit IR-variability, including 7 class 0/I and 12 flat spectrum YSOs. A further 177 tentative candidates are identified by their location in the IRAC [3.6] versus [3.6]-[5.8] color-magnitude diagram. The authors find strong evidence of subclustering in the region. Three subclusters were identified surrounding the central cluster, with massive and variable stars in each subcluster. The central region shows evidence of distinct spatial distributions of the protostars and pre-main-sequence stars. A previously detected IR cluster, DB2001_Obj36, has been established as a subcluster of RCW 38. This suggests that star formation in RCW 38 occurs over a more extended area than previously thought. The gas-to-dust ratio is examined using the X-ray derived hydrogen column density, NH and the K-band extinction, and found to be consistent with the diffuse interstellar medium, in contrast with Serpens and NGC 1333.

See the documentation below for descriptions of these parameters. The catalog consists of all primary source parameters from the automated detection algorithm employed by the SASS. In addition each observation has been quality checked, both by automatic algorithms and by detailed visual inspection. The results of this quality checking are contained as a set of logical-value flags for a set of principal source parameters. If a source parameter is suspect, the associated flag is set to a corresponding alphabetical value; parameters with no obvious problems maintain the default, &apos;.&apos;, value. The Second ROSAT Pointed PSPC Filter Source Catalog includes missing sources, i.e. obvious sources which were not detected by the SASS source detection software but which could be easily detected by visual inspection. Missed sources are marked by negative values of their source identification number, i.e. the parameter &apos;MPLSX_ID&apos; has a negative value for these sources. The only tabulated quantities for these visually identified missed sources are source positions; other quantities (like count rates, hardness ratios, etc.) are not available. These data have been screened by ROSAT data centers in the US, Germany, and the UK as a step in the production of the ROSAT Results Archive.

It focusses on the analysis of the 843 X-ray sources which have unique radio counterparts. The majority of these objects (84%) have optical counterparts on the POSS 1 plates. Approximately 30% have been previously classified and the authors obtain new spectroscopic classifications for 85 sources by comparison with the ongoing FIRST Bright Quasar Survey and 106 additional sources from their own new spectroscopic data. Approximately 51% of the sources are presently classified, and the majority of the unclassified objects are optically faint. The newly classified sources are generally radio weak, exhibiting properties intermediate with previous samples of radio- and X-ray-selected AGN. This also holds for the subsample of 71 BL Lacs which includes many intermediate objects. The 146 quasars show no evidence for a bimodal distribution in their radio-loudness parameter, indicating that the supposed division between radio-quiet and radio-loud AGN may not be real.

The authors observed Omega Cen with XMM-Newton on August 13th, 2001. The observation lasted 37 ks and was performed with the medium filter. The authors detected 11 and 27 faint X-ray sources in the core and half mass radii, respectively, searching down to a luminosity of 1.3 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;31&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; ergs s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; in the 0.5 - 5 keV range (for an assumed distance to Omega Cen of 5.3 kpc).

The bulk of sources are hard and spectrally similar to CVs. The lack of soft faint sources might be related to the absence of millisecond pulsars in the cluster. The XMM-Newton observations reveal the presence of an excess of sources well outside the core of the cluster where several RS CVn binaries have already been found. The authors also analyzed a publicly available Chandra ACIS-I observation performed on January 24 - 25th, 2000, to improve the XMM-Newton source positions and to search for source intensity variations between the two data sets. 63 XMM-Newton sources have a Chandra counterpart, and 15 sources within the half-mass radius have shown time variability. Overall, the general properties of the faint X-ray sources in omega Cen suggest that they are predominantly CVs and active binaries (RS CVn or BY Dra). This table lists all 146 X-ray sources detected in the XMM-Newton observation above a maximum likelihood threshold in the 0.5 - 5 keV band of 12, including the 27 sources within the half-mass radius (listed in Table 1 of the reference paper), and the 119 sources outside the half-mass radius (listed in Table 2 of the reference paper). About 9 of the 27 sources within the half-mass radius are expected to be background sources, as are ~ 65 of the sources within 12.5 arcminutes of the cluster center, i.e., a significant fraction of the 146 total observed X-ray sources.

For the sources with 2MASS counterparts, the values of their magnitudes in the J, H and K bands are also given. Very little is known about the evolution of stellar activity between the ages of the Hyades (0.8 Gyr) and the Sun (4.6 Gyr). To gain information on the typical level of coronal activity at a star&apos;s intermediate age, the authors have studied the X-ray emission from stars in the 1.9 Gyr-old open cluster NGC 752. They analyzed a ~ 140 ks Chandra observation of NGC 752 and a ~50 ks XMM-Newton observation of the same cluster. They detected 262 X-ray sources in the Chandra data and 145 sources in the XMM-Newton observation. Around 90% of the catalogued cluster members within Chandra&apos;s field of view are detected in the X-ray observation. The X-ray luminosity of all observed cluster members (28 stars) and of 11 cluster member candidates was derived. These data indicate that, at an age of 1.9 Gyr, the typical X-ray luminosity L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;x&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; of the cluster members with masses of 0.8 to 1.2 solar masses is 1.3 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;28&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, which is approximately a factor of 6 times less intense than that observed in the younger Hyades. Given that L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;x&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; is proportional to the square of a star&apos;s rotational rate, the median L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;x&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; of NGC 752 is consistent, for t &amp;amp;gt;= 1 Gyr, with a decaying rate in rotational velocities v&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;rot&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ t&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-alpha&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; with alpha ~ 0.75, steeper than the Skumanich relation (alpha ~ 0.5) and significantly steeper than that observed between the Pleiades and the Hyades (where alpha &amp;amp;lt;0.3), suggesting that a change in the rotational regimes of the stellar interiors is taking place at an age of ~ 1 Gyr. The 135 ks observation of NGC 752 was performed by the Chandra ACIS camera on September 29, 2003 starting at 21:11:59 UT. The X-ray source detection was performed on the event list using the Wavelet Transform detection algorithm developed at Palermo Astronomical Observatory PWDETECT, available at &amp;amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://oapa.astropa.unipa.it/progetti_ricerca/PWDetect&quot;&amp;amp;gt;http://oapa.astropa.unipa.it/progetti_ricerca/PWDetect&amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;gt;. Initially, the energy range 0.2 - 10 keV was selected and the threshold for source detection was taken as to ensure a maximum of 1-2 spurious sources per field. 169 sources were detected in this way. The analysis of these sources hardness ratios showed, however, that all the catalogued stars in the field had low hardness ratios, HR &amp;amp;lt; ~ 0.2, where HR is the number of photons in the 2 - 8 keV band over the number in the 0.5 - 2 keV band. Thus, to maximize the detection of stellar sources, PWDETECT was applied to the event list in the energy range from 0.5 - 2 keV. Using a detection threshold which ensures less than 1 spurious source per field leads to the detection of 188 sources, while lowering this threshold to 10 spurious sources per field, allows 262 sources to be identified in this energy range. This is a significant increase (well above the number expected if all the additional sources were spurious), thus the authors retained this list of 262 sources as their final list of sources in the NGC 752 field, with the caveat that ~ 10 sources among them are likely spurious. Note that the existence of ~ 10 spurious sources in the list is not so much of a problem in this context, because cluster members or candidate members are identified by the existence of a visible or near-IR counterpart. The authors searched for 2MASS counterparts to the X-ray sources using the 2MASS Point Source Catalogue (PSC) and a search radius of 3 arcsec and found a counterpart for 43 sources. Searching within the Point Source Reject Table of the 2MASS Extended Mission leads to the further identification of 1 counterpart (source number 87).</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=ngc752cxo&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/ngc752cxo.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

After more than nine years of observations, the OMC database contains light curves for more than 70 000 sources (with more than 50 photometric points each). The objectives of the present work have been to characterize the potential variability of the objects monitored by OMC, to identify periodic sources and to compute their periods, taking advantage of the stability and long monitoring time of the OMC. The first catalog of variable sources observed by OMC has been developed with observations from October 2002 to February 2010. To detect potential variability, the authors have performed a chi-squared test, finding 5263 variable sources, for 1337 of which the periods have been determined, out of an initial sample of 6071 objects with good photometric quality and more than 300 data points each. They have studied the potential periodicity of these sources using a method based on the phase dispersion minimization technique, optimized to handle light curves with very different shapes. For each object in the catalog, the median of the visual magnitude, the magnitude at maximum and minimum brightness in the light curve during the window of observations and the period, when found, are provided. The types of variable objects in the catalogue include eclipsing binaries, pulsating stars, rotating stars, eruptive stars, extragalactic objects, X-ray binaries, cataclysmic variables, Be stars and other objects with unknown kinds of variability.

They obtained discovery spectra, primarily on 3m-class telescopes, for 1,040 of these candidates and confirmed 86% as AGN, with redshifts generally at z &amp;amp;gt; 0.5. Including a small set of observed secondary candidates, the authors report the discovery of 217 AGN with GALEX FUV magnitudes &amp;amp;lt; 18 mag that previously had no reported spectroscopic redshifts. These are excellent potential targets for UV spectroscopy before the end of the Hubble Space Telescope mission. The main data products of UVQS are publicly available through the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST). The authors have performed an all-sky survey for z ~ 1, FUV-bright quasars selected from GALEX and WISE photometry. In several of the observing runs, conditions were unexpectedly favorable and we exhausted the primary candidates at certain right ascension ranges. To fill the remaining observing time, they generated a secondary candidate list. This secondary set of 2,010 candidates is also contained in this HEASARC table (entries with source_sample = &apos;S&apos;). The authors proceeded to obtain discovery-quality long-slit spectra (i.e., low-dispersion, large-wavelength coverage, modest signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of their UV-bright Quasar Survey (UVQS) candidates in one calendar year. The principal facilities were: (i) the dual Kast spectrometer on the 3m Shane telescope at the Lick Observatory; (ii) the Boller &amp;amp;amp; Chivens (BCS) spectrometer on the Irenee du Pont 100-inch telescope at the Las Campanas Observatory; and (iii) the Calar Alto Faint Object Spectrograph on the CAHA 2.2-meter telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory (CAHA). They acquired an additional ~20 spectra on larger aperture telescopes (Keck/ESI, MMT/MBC, Magellan/MagE) during twilight or under poor observing conditions. Typical exposure times were limited to &amp;amp;lt; ~200s, with adjustments for fainter sources or sub-optimal observing conditions. Table 3 in the reference paper provides a list of the details of the observations of these candidates. From the total candidates list of 3,460 objects, the authors measured high-quality redshifts (redshift quality flag values of 3 or greater) for 1,121 sources.

Many of these were assigned z = 0 exactly. The remainder of the UVQS sources were assumed to be extragalactic AGN, and the derived redshift information for these sources (which was given in Table 4 of the reference paper) has been incorporated into this HEASARC representation of UVQS. Finally, there were 93 sources with good-quality spectra for which we cannot the authors could not recover a secure redshift.

(1999ApJ...524..423C), which can characterize both point-like and extended sources, the authors identified 21325 sources. Among them, 16758 are serendipitous, i.e. not associated with the targets of the pointings, and do not require a non-automated analysis. This makes this catalog the largest compilation of Chandra sources as of the date of publication of this catalog (August 2008). The 0.5 - 10 keV absorption corrected fluxes of these sources range from ~3 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-16&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; to 9 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-12&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg/cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;/s with a median of 7 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-15&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg/cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;/s. The catalog consists of count rates and relative errors in three energy bands (total, 0.5 - 7 keV; soft, 0.5 - 2 keV; and hard, 2 - 7 keV), and source positions relative to the highest signal-to-noise detection among the three bands. The wavelet algorithm also provides an estimate of the extension of the source. The authors include information drawn from the headers of the original files, as well, and extracted source counts in four additional energy bands, SB1 (0.5 - 1 keV), SB2 (1 - 2 keV), HB1 (2 - 4 keV), and HB2 (4 - 7 keV). They computed the sky coverage for the full catalog and for a subset at high Galactic latitude (|b| &amp;amp;gt; 20 degrees). The complete catalog provides a sky coverage in the soft band (0.5 - 2 keV, S/N = 3) of ~8 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; at a limiting flux of 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-13&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg/cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;/s, and ~2 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; at a limiting flux of ~10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-15&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg/cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;/s.

These quasars cover a redshift range of z = 0.11 - 5.41 and a magnitude range of i = 15.3 - 20.7. Substantial numbers of radio-loud (70) and broad absorption line (51) quasars exist within this sample.

The work is complemented by an extensive collection of multi-wavelength data from 24 microns to UV, available from the COSMOS survey, for each of the X-ray sources, including spectroscopic redshifts for &amp;amp;gt;~50% of the sample, and high-quality photometric redshifts for the rest. The XMM-Newton and multi-wavelength flux limits are well matched: 1760 (98%) of the X-ray sources have optical counterparts, 1711 (~95%) have IRAC counterparts, and 1394 (~78%) have MIPS 24 um detections. Thanks to the redshift completeness (almost 100%) the authors were able to constrain the high-luminosity tail of the X-ray luminosity function confirming that the peak of the number density of log L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt; 44.5 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is at z ~ 2. Spectroscopically identified obscured and unobscured AGNs, as well as normal and star-forming galaxies, present well-defined optical and infrared properties. The authors devised a robust method to identify a sample of ~150 high-redshift (z &amp;amp;gt; 1), obscured AGN candidates for which optical spectroscopy is not available.

The authors studied in detail the optical spectrum and the overall spectral energy distribution of a prototypical Type 2 QSO (source number 2028), caught in a stage transitioning from being starburst dominated to AGN dominated, which was possible to isolate only thanks to the combination of X-ray and infrared observations.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=xmmcosmoid&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/xmmcosmoid.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

A comparison of BATSE results with data at higher energies is used to estimate the robustness of the data analysis. While the detection level of each source is reliable, the flux measurement may be overestimated in some sources by as much as 35%, probably because of incomplete data cleaning. Comparison of BATSE fluxes with X-ray fluxes obtained in the 2-10 keV range and averaged over years indicates that a canonical power law of photon index 1.7 gives a good description of the broadband spectra of bright active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and that spectral breaks preferentially occur above 100 keV.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=cbatpicagn&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/cbatpicagn.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The observations were taken in 2 simultaneous 100-MHz wide bands centered at 3.04 and 3.14 GHz approximately once per day between 2009 May and 2011 April. Each image covers 11.8 square degrees and has 100&amp;amp;quot; FWHM resolution. Deep images for each of the four fields have rms noise between 180 and 310 microJy (uJy), and the corresponding catalogs contain ~200 sources in each field. Typically 40-50 of these sources are detected in each single-epoch image. This represents one of the shortest cadence, largest area, multi-epoch surveys undertaken at these frequencies. The authors compared the catalogs generated from the combined images to those from individual epochs, and from monthly averages, as well as to legacy surveys. They undertook a search for transients, with particular emphasis on excluding false positive sources,but find no confirmed transients, defined here as sources that can be shown to have varied by at least a factor of 10. However, the authors found one source that brightened in a single-epoch image to at least six times the upper limit from the corresponding deep image. They also found a source associated with a z = 0.6 quasar which appears to have brightened by a factor ~3 in one of their deep images, when compared to catalogs from legacy surveys. The authors place new upper limits on the number of transients brighter than 10 mJy: fewer than 0.08 transients deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; with characteristic timescales of months to years; fewer than 0.02 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; with timescales of months; and fewer than 0.009 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; with timescales of days. In this study, the authors accepted only as real sources those that are independently detected in both frequencies in at least one epoch (with a position matching tolerance of 50&amp;amp;quot;, corresponding to a false match probability of &amp;amp;lt;2%). Their threshold of ~ 4.2 sigma for detection in a single image corresponds to a threshold of ~ 5.9 sigma in the dual-image catalog. They generated catalogs for the deep fields, consisting only of sources detected at both frequencies, and these are contained in the present HEASARC table. Notice that the authors previously published a list of 425 radio sources in the NDWFS field in the constellation of Bootes in an earlier paper (Bower et al 2010, ApJ, 725, 1792, available as the HEASARC database table PIGSSBOOFD).

       "<tr><td>405</td><td>x-ray</td><td>CBFGRXECXO</td><td>ivo://nasa.heasarc/cbfgrxecxo</td><td>Apparently diffuse X-ray emission has been known to exist along the central quarter of the Galactic Plane since the beginning of X-ray astronomy; this is referred to as the Galactic Ridge X-ray emission (GRXE). Recent deep X-ray observations have shown that numerous X-ray point sources account for a large fraction of the GRXE in the hard band (2 - 8 keV). However, the nature of these sources is poorly understood. Using the deepest X-ray observations made in the Chandra bulge field, the authors present the result of a coherent photometric and spectroscopic analysis of individual X-ray point sources for the purpose of constraining their nature and deriving their fractional contributions to the hard-band continuum and Fe K line emission of the GRXE. Based on the X-ray color-color diagram, they divided the point sources into three groups: A (hard), B (soft and broad spectrum), and C (soft and peaked spectrum). The group A sources are further decomposed spectrally into thermal and non-thermal sources with different fractions in different flux ranges. From their X-ray properties, the authors speculate that the group A non-thermal sources are mostly active galactic nuclei and the thermal sources are mostly white dwarf (WD) binaries such as magnetic and non-magnetic cataclysmic variables (CVs), pre-CVs, and symbiotic stars, whereas the group B and C sources are X-ray active stars in flares and quiescence, respectively. In the log N - log S curve of the 2 - 8 keV band, the group A non-thermal sources are dominant above ~10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-14&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg/cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;/s, which is gradually taken over by Galactic sources in the fainter flux ranges. The Fe K-alpha emission is mostly from the group A thermal (WD binaries) and the group B (X-ray active stars) sources. The authors retrieved 10 archived data sets of the Chandra bulge field (CBF) taken with the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer-I (ACIS-I; 0.5 - 8.0 keV energy band with a spectral resolution of ~280 eV for the full width at half-maximum at 5.9keV) array on board Chandra. The observations were carried out from 2008 May to August with a total exposure time of ~900 ks. The authors first extracted point-source candidates using the wavdetect algorithm in the CIAO package. They set the significance threshold at 2.5 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-5&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, implying that one false positive detection would be expected at every 4 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;4&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; trials. As a result, 2596 source candidates were found. The number of their source candidates is nearly the same as that found by Revnivtsev et al.(2009, A&amp;amp;amp;A, 507, 1211) in the same region. To select significant point sources from the candidates, the authors examined their validity based on their photometric significance (PS) and the probability of no source (P&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;B&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;). The PS is defined as the background-subtracted source counts (C&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;net&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;) divided by its background counts normalized by the area. P&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;B&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; is the probability that the source is attributable to a background fluctuation, assuming Poisson statistics. The authors recognized a source to be valid if it satisfied both these criteria: PS &amp;amp;gt;= 1.0 and P&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;B&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;= 1.0 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;.

For these latter sources a complete covering at 20 cm down to the 5-sigma flux limit of 2.5 mJy is already available with the NRAO/VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) while the FIRST survey (Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimeters) is available only for 27 HELLAS sources (5-sigma limit of ~ 1 mJy).In order to obtain information also on the radio spectral properties of the HELLAS sources the authors adopted the following strategy. All the 147 HELLAS sources were observed at 6 cm down to a 1 -sigma flux limit of ~ 0.10 - 0.25 mJy. For the 20 HELLAS sources observed with the ATCA, they took advantage of the fact that the 6 and 3 cm receivers of the ATCA share a common feed-horn and they observed simultaneously also at 3 cm, obtaining a 3-cm flux limit of ~ 0.22 mJy (1-sigma level). Starting from the radio position of the 53 X-ray/radio associations, the authors searched for optical counterparts within 5 arcseconds from the radio position using the optical positions of the 61 HELLAS sources identified by La Franca et al.

The Hyades survey covered over 900 square degrees of the sky. Over 185 optically identified Hyades were detected down to a limiting X-ray luminosity of about 1-2x10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;28&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; ergs/s in the 0.1-1.8keV energy band. Among solar-like stars, i.e., main-sequence stars of spectral type G, the RASS detection rate was about 90%. Stern et al. argue that the presence of many binary systems in the cluster is a key factor influencing the Hyades X-ray luminosity function. Short-period (a few days or less) binaries are anomalously X-ray bright, as might have been expected; however, the X-ray luminosity functions of K and possibly M binary stars of all types are significantly different from their single counterparts, confirming the results of Pye et al. (1994, MNRAS, 266, 798) based on a smaller K star sample drawn from deep ROSAT pointings. Comparison with Einstein Observatory studies of a subset of Hyades stars demonstrates a general lack of significant (&amp;amp;gt; a factor of 2) long-term X-ray variability. Stern et al. suggest that this may be the result of the dominance of a small-scale, turbulent dynamo in the younger Hyades stars compared to the large-scale, cyclic dynamo observed in the Sun. The HYADESXRAY database consists of X-ray data for 440 probable and possible Hyades members that were included in the Stern et al. survey and were listed in Table 1 of their published paper.

To facilitate their interpretation of the X-ray image, they compiled a multi-wavelength catalog of nearly 2900 known objects in the region by combining 17 different catalogs from the recent literature. They defined two reference groups: an infrared sample, containing all objects detected in the K band, and an optical sample comprising low-extinction, well-characterized ONC members. They showed for both samples that field object contamination is generally low. Their X-ray sources are primarily low-mass ONC members. The detection rate for optical sample stars increases monotonically with stellar mass from zero at the brown dwarf limit to ~100% for the most massive stars but shows a pronounced dip between 2 and 10 M&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;sun&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;.

The authors have cataloged 200 redshifts for the A370 field. In the reference paper, they construct differential number counts for the central regions (radius &amp;amp;lt; 16&apos;) of this cluster, and find that the faint (S&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;1.4GHz&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt; 3 mJy) counts of A370 are roughly consistent with the highest blank field number counts. Their analyses indicate that the number counts are primarily from field radio galaxies. The authors suggest that the disagreement of their number counts for this cluster with those from a similarly deep observation of A2390 that was also presented in the reference paper can be largely attributed to cosmic variance. The authors observed the A370 cluster field with the VLA in the A configuration for ~42.4hr on-source during 1999 August and September. K. S. Dwarakanath observed A370 in the B configuration for ~18.4hr on-source during 1994 August and September. The field center is located at 02:39:32 -01:35:07 (J2000).

The data processing was performed at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory (MSSL, University College London, U.K.) using Swift FTOOLS from NASA&apos;s High Energy Astrophysics Software package (HEASoft-6.11), with some customizing of the UVOT packages in order to get more complete source detection and to properly apply quality flags to those sources that were detected within the UVOT image artifacts. The total number of observations with 17&apos;x17&apos; images used for version 1 of the catalog is 23,059, giving 6,200,016 sources in total, of which 2,027,265 have multiple entries in the source table because they have been detected in more than one observation. Some sources were only observed in one filter. The total number of entries in the source table is 13,860,568.

Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) photometry (3-8 micron) is combined with Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) near-IR data to identify young stellar objects (YSOs) by IR-excess emission from their circumstellar material. Chandra X-ray data are used to identify class III pre-main-sequence stars lacking circumstellar material. The authors identify 624 YSOs: 23 class 0/I and 90 flat spectrum (FS) protostars, 437 class II stars, and 74 class III stars. They also identify 29 (27 new) O star candidates over the IRAC field. Seventy-two stars exhibit IR-variability, including 7 class 0/I and 12 flat spectrum YSOs. A further 177 tentative candidates are identified by their location in the IRAC [3.6] versus [3.6]-[5.8] color-magnitude diagram. The authors find strong evidence of subclustering in the region. Three subclusters were identified surrounding the central cluster, with massive and variable stars in each subcluster. The central region shows evidence of distinct spatial distributions of the protostars and pre-main-sequence stars. A previously detected IR cluster, DB2001_Obj36, has been established as a subcluster of RCW 38. This suggests that star formation in RCW 38 occurs over a more extended area than previously thought. The gas-to-dust ratio is examined using the X-ray derived hydrogen column density, NH and the K-band extinction, and found to be consistent with the diffuse interstellar medium, in contrast with Serpens and NGC 1333. The authors posit that the high photoionizing flux of massive stars in RCW 38 affects the agglomeration of the dust grains. This table contains the list of 624 young stellar objects (given in Tables 3 and 4 of the reference paper) found among the Spitzer sources in the field of RCW 38 using the two selection techniques described in Section 3 of the reference paper: (1) selection of stars with IR excesses in IR color-color diagrams, and (2) identification of X-ray luminous YSOs by comparing X-ray sources with IR detections. The latter technique was used to identify Type III YSOs lacking emission from a dusty disk.

Depending on the amount of blocked radiation, the flux from the AGN can be too faint to be detected by currently operating hard X-ray (above 15 keV) missions. At these energies, only ~1% of the intensity of the cosmic X-ray background (CXB) can be resolved into point-like sources that are AGNs. In this work, the authors address the question of undetected sources contributing to the CXB with a very sensitive and new hard X-ray survey: the Swift-INTEGRAL X-ray (SIX) survey, which is obtained with the new approach of combining the Swift/BAT and INTEGRAL/IBIS X-ray observations. The authors merge the observations of both missions, which enhances the exposure time and reduces systematic uncertainties. As a result, they obtain a new survey over a wide sky area of 6200 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; covering the region of the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) and extending to the contiguous Coma region that is more sensitive than the surveys of Swift/BAT or INTEGRAL/IBIS alone. Their sample comprises 113 sources having S/N ratios of above 4.8 sigma: 86 AGNs (Seyfert-like and blazars), 5 galaxies, 2 clusters of galaxies, 3 Galactic sources, 3 previously detected unidentified X-ray sources, and 14 unidentified sources. The scientific outcome from the study of the sample has been properly addressed to study the evolution of AGNs at a redshift below 0.4.

The survey covers a 2.6 square degree area with a mean rms of ~2.3 &amp;amp;micro;Jy/beam (&amp;amp;micro;Jy/beam), cataloguing 10,830 sources above 5 sigma, and enclosing the full 2 square degree COSMOS field. By combining these radio data with optical, near-infrared (UltraVISTA), and mid-infrared (Spitzer/IRAC) data, as well as X-ray data (Chandra), the authors find counterparts to radio sources for ~93% of the total radio sample in the unmasked areas of the COSMOS field, i.e., those not affected by saturated or bright sources in the optical to near-IR (NIR) bands, reaching out to z ~ 6. They further classify the sources as star-forming galaxies or AGN based on various criteria, such as X-ray luminosity, observed mid-infrare (MIR) color, UV-far-infrared (FIR) spectral-energy distribution (SED), rest-frame near-ultraviolet (NUV)-optical color corrected for dust extinction, and radio-excess relative to that expected from the the hosts&apos; star-formation rate. The authors separate the AGN into sub-samples dominated by low-to-moderate and moderate-to-high radiative luminosity AGN, i.e., candidates for high-redshift analogs to local low- and high-excitation emission line AGN, respectively. They study the fractional contributions of these sub-populations down to radio flux levels of ~11 uJy at 3 GHz (or ~20 uJy at 1.4 GHz assuming a spectral index of -0.7), and find that the dominant fraction at 1.4 GHz flux densities above ~200 uJy is constituted of low-to-moderate radiative luminosity AGN MLAGN). Below densities of ~100 uJy the fraction of star-forming galaxies (SFG) increases to ~60%, followed by the moderate-to-high radiative luminosity AGN (HLAGN) with ~20%, and MLAGN with ~20%. Based on this observational evidence, the authors extrapolate the fractions down to sensitivities of the Square Kilometer Array (SKA). Their estimates suggest that at the faint flux limits to be reached by the (Wide, Deep, and UltraDeep) SKA1 surveys, a selection based only on radio flux limits can provide a simple tool to efficiently identify samples highly (&amp;amp;gt;75%) dominated by star-forming galaxies.

Availability of publishable light curves, images, and spectra (which can also be readily re-fitted) should be particularly valuable to astronomers with little direct experience in the reduction of X-ray data.

Based on the ratio of flux in the two bands, the authors separate the detected sources into two populations, one consistent with synchrotron emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the other consistent with thermal emission from dust. In the reference paper, the authors present source counts for each population from 11 to 640 mJy at 1.4 mm and from 4.4 to 800 mJy at 2.0 mm. The 2.0-mm counts are dominated by synchrotron-dominated sources across the reported flux range; the 1.4-mm counts are dominated by synchrotron-dominated sources above ~15 mJy and by dust-dominated sources below that flux level. The authors detect 141 synchrotron-dominated sources and 47 dust-dominated sources at signal-to-noise ratio S/N &amp;amp;gt; 4.5 in at least one band. All of the most significantly detected members of the synchrotron-dominated population are associated with sources in previously published radio catalogs. Some of the dust-dominated sources are associated with nearby (z &amp;amp;lt;&amp;amp;lt; 1) galaxies whose dust emission is also detected by the Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS). However, most of the bright, dust-dominated sources have no counterparts in any existing catalogs. The authors argue that these sources represent the rarest and brightest members of the population commonly referred to as sub-millimeter galaxies (SMGs). During the 2008 observing season, the 960-element South Pole Telescope (SPT) camera included detectors sensitive to radiation within bands centered at approximately 1.4 mm, 2.0 mm, and 3.2 mm (220 GHz, 150 GHz, and 95 GHz). Result in this reference paper are based on 607 hr of observing time, using only the 1.4-mm and 2.0-mm data from the 87 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; portion of the field that was mapped with near-uniform coverage. Main-lobe beams were measured using the brightest sources in the field and were adequately fit by two-dimensional Gaussians with FWHM equal to 1.05 and 1.15 arcminutes at 1.4 mm and 2.0 mm, respectively. The typical rms of the filtered 2.0-mm and 1.4-mm maps used for source candidate identification (shown in Figures 1 and 2, respectively, of the reference paper) is 1.3 mJy at 2.0 mm and 3.4 mJy at 1.4 mm. Detections in both bands are listed in the final catalog as a single source if they are offset &amp;amp;lt;30 arcseconds between the two bands. For sources detected in both bands, the authors adopt the position of the more significant detection. The argue that they are far enough above the confusion limit that this simple and intuitive method is adequate. For sources detected in only one band, the authors use the flux in the cleaned map for the second band at the position of the detection.

In particular, it includes the apparent outburst and quiescent V-band magnitudes, duty cycles, limits on the recurrence time, upper- and lower-limits on the distance and absolute quiescent magnitudes, color information, orbital parameters, and X-ray counterparts. These properties were determined by means of a classification script presented in the reference paper. The DNs in the catalog show a correlation between the outburst duty cycle and the orbital period (and outburst recurrence time), as well as between the quiescent absolute magnitude and the orbital period (and duty cycle). This is the largest sample of dwarf nova properties collected to date (2016). Besides serving as a useful reference for individual systems and a means of selecting objects for targeted studies, it will prove valuable for statistical studies that aim to shed light on the formation and evolution of cataclysmic variables. The CRTS identifies transients in the data from the Catalina Sky Survey (Larson et al. 1998, BAAS, 30, 1037; 2003, BAAS, 35, 982), a photometric survey that searches for Potentially Hazardous Asteroids and Near Earth Objects. Three sub-surveys constitute the Catalina Sky Survey, namely the original CSS (Catalina Schmidt Survey), the MLS (Mt Lemmon Survey) based in Arizona, and the SSS (Siding Spring Survey) in Australia, which ended on 2014 July 5. The field of view and typical limiting magnitude for each survey (at ~30 s integrations) are 8.2 degrees and V~19.5 mag for the CSS, 1.1 degrees and V~21.5 mag for the MLS, and 4 degrees and V~19 mag for the SSS.

X-ray data from Chandra (four pointings) and XMM-Newton (seven pointings) were reduced and source detection algorithm applied to each image. The authors complement the X-ray data with optical and near-IR data from the IPHAS, UKIDSS, and 2MASS catalogs, and with other published optical and Spitzer IR data. More than 700 X-ray sources are detected, the majority of which have an optical or NIR counterpart. This allowed the authors to identify young stars in different stages of formation. Less than 30% of the X-ray sources are identified with a previously known young star. the authors argue that most X-ray sources with an optical or NIR counterpart, except perhaps for a few tens at near-zero reddening, are likely candidate members of the star-forming region, on the basis of both their optical and NIR magnitudes and colors, and of their X-ray properties such as spectral hardness or flux variations. They are characterized by a wide range of extinction, and sometimes near-IR excesses, both of which prevent derivation of accurate stellar parameters. The optical color-magnitude diagram suggests ages between 1-10 Myr. The X-ray members have a very complex spatial distribution with some degree of subclustering, qualitatively similar to that of previously known members. The detailed distribution of X-ray sources relative to the objects with IR excesses identified with Spitzer is sometimes suggestive of sequential star formation, especially near the &apos;Gulf of Mexico&apos; region, probably triggered by the O5 star which illuminates the whole region. The authors confirm that around the O5 star no enhancement in the young star density is found, in agreement with previous results. Thanks to the precision and depth of the IPHAS and UKIDSS data used, the authors also determine the local optical-IR reddening law, and compute an updated reddening map of the entire region.

The COSBRAW database table is a log of the 65 COS-B observation intervals and contains target names, sky coordinates start times and other information taken from the final COS-B database produced by ESA in 1985. This final database consisted of three basic datasets: `OBSLI`, a dataset describing each observation period, typically a month; `OURLI`, a dataset describing each uninterrupted observation interval, lasting between 10 minutes and 10 hours; and `GAMLI`, a dataset containing records for each accepted gamma-ray photon. These three data sets were combined into FITS format images at NASA/GSFC. The images were formed by making the center pixel of a 1024 x 1024 pixel image correspond to the RA and DEC given in the `OBSLI` file.

They detected 468 X-ray sources with a photometric significance &amp;amp;gt;=1.0 and a 1% or less chance of being a background fluctuation, and identified optical, near-infrared (NIR), and Spitzer mid-infrared (MIR) counterparts for 379 of them. The unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity of the X-ray image, enhanced by optical and infrared imaging data, yielded the following results: (1) The central OB association Westerlund 2 is resolved for the first time in the X-ray band. X-ray emission is detected from all spectroscopically identified early-type stars in this region. (2) Most (~ 86%) X-ray sources with optical or infrared identifications are cluster members in comparison with a control field in the Galactic plane. (3) A loose constraint (2-5 kpc) for the distance to RCW 49 is derived from the mean X-ray luminosity of T Tauri stars. (4) The cluster X-ray population consists of low-mass pre-main-sequence and early-type stars as obtained from X-ray and NIR photometry. About 30 new OB star candidates are identified. (5) The authors estimate a cluster radius of 6&apos; - 7&apos; based on the X-ray surface number density profiles. (6) A large fraction (~ 90%) of cluster members are identified individually using complimentary X-ray and MIR excess emission. (7) The brightest five X-ray sources, two Wolf-Rayet stars and three O stars, have hard thermal spectra. The X-ray observation of RCW 49 was carried out using the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) on board the Chandra X-Ray Observatory from 2003 August 23 UT 18:20 to August 24 UT 4:54.

ACIS-I covers the 0.5 - 8.0 keV energy band with a spectral resolution of ~ 150 eV at 6 keV and a point-spread function (PSF) radius of ~ 0.5&amp;amp;quot; within ~ 2&apos; of the on-axis position, degrading to ~ 6&amp;amp;quot; at a 10&apos; off-axis angle. The data were taken with the very faint telemetry mode and the timed exposure CCD operation with a frame time of 3.2 s. Sources with photometric significance of larger than 2 were fitted with an absorbed thin thermal plasma model. The abundance was fixed to be 0.3 times the solar value. Fits lacking uncertainties, fits with large uncertainties, and fits with frozen parameters should be viewed merely as splines to the data to obtain rough estimates of the X-ray luminosities: the listed parameter values are considered unreliable in such cases.

The first version of the UVOTSSC has been produced by processing the image data obtained from the Swift Ultraviolet and Optical Telescope (UVOT). The data processing was performed at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory (MSSL, University College London, U.K.) using Swift FTOOLS from NASA&apos;s High Energy Astrophysics Software package (HEASoft-6.11), with some customizing of the UVOT packages in order to get more complete source detection and to properly apply quality flags to those sources that were detected within the UVOT image artifacts. The total number of observations with 17&apos;x17&apos; images used for version 1 of the catalog is 23,059, giving 6,200,016 sources in total, of which 2,027,265 have multiple entries in the source table because they have been detected in more than one observation. Some sources were only observed in one filter. The total number of entries in the source table is 13,860,568. The S/N ratio for all sources exceeds 5 in at least one UVOT filter, the rest of the filters having a S/N greater than 3. One Swift ObsID can consist of one or more images, which for this catalog have been summed, yielding the quoted total exposure times. The original UVOT images can be found in the on-line archives at MAST, and in the Swift archives at &amp;amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://swift.ac.uk/&quot;&amp;amp;gt;http://swift.ac.uk/&amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;gt; and at the HEASARC (&amp;amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/swiftmastr.html&quot;&amp;amp;gt;http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/swiftmastr.html&amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;gt;), using the ObsID as the search key. For higher temporal resolution, the original images need to be used because the catalog data herein are summed over all of the individual images within an ObsID. The upper limits per filter for the summed images are constructed for each ObsID because the sensitivity hardly varies over the detector. Usually the images within one ObsID share the same pointing, however, whereas the quoted upper limits always apply for sources near the pointing direction given, if the images had small offsets in pointing they may not apply to sources near the edge of the summed image, which is typically about 8 arcminutes from the quoted pointing direction.

This catalog contains infrared observational data for sources outside the Solar System, constructed through a search of the most active scientific journals, IR surveys and catalogs. To date, about 6200 journal articles and 10 major survey catalogs have been included in the database from which this catalog was constructed. The catalog in its original form contains 374,653 individual observations of about 62,000 different infrared sources. More than 8000 of these sources are identifiable with visible objects. For sources with no published IR source position, a nominal position may have been given based on other sources. Nominal positions are usually the best available, but not necessarily the true IR positions. The HEASARC has removed 1136 of the 374,653 entries in the catalog in its original form for which there was no positional information, leaving 373,517 remaining entries in this HEASARC-realized version.

Infrared photometry (2MASS and Spitzer) shows that the X-ray population is very young: 3 older Class III stars, 16 classical T Tauri stars, and 6 protostars including a Class 0/I system. The authors infer a total T Tauri population of ~ 30 stars in the globule, including the undetected population, with a star formation efficiency of 1%-4%. An elongated source spatial distribution with an age gradient oriented toward the exciting star is discovered in the X-ray population of IC 1396N, supporting similar findings in other cometary globules. The geometric and age distribution is consistent with the radiation-driven implosion (RDI) model for triggered star formation in CGs by H II region shocks.

Using two 40 ks Chandra observations, The authors have detected 213 X-ray sources in the ~ 17&apos; x 17&apos; ACIS-I field. They combine the X-ray data with Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) near-IR observations and Spitzer Space Telescope (SST) IRAC and MIPS 24-micron observations to obtain a complete picture of the cluster. A total of 158 of the X-ray sources have infrared counterparts. Of these, the authors find nine protostars, 48 Class II objects, five transition objects, and 72 Class III objects. From the Spitzer data, they identify an additional 10 protostars, 53 Class II objects, and four transition disk candidates which are not detected by Chandra. (These objects are not included in this HEASARC table which contains the multi-wavelength data for only the 213 detected X-ray sources). The authors obtained optical spectra of a sample of both X-ray-detected and non-X-ray-detected objects. Combining the X-ray, Spitzer, and spectral data, they obtain independent estimates of cluster distance and the total cluster size - excluding protostars. The authors obtain consistent distance estimates of 510 (+100,-40) pc and a total cluster size of 255 (+50,-25) stars. They find the Class II:III ratio is about 5:7 with some evidence that the Class III sources are spatially more dispersed. The cluster appears very young with three sites of active star formation and a median age of about 1 Myr. The field was observed by Chandra on 2005 March 6 starting at 17:16 UT for 40.2 ks of total time and 39.6 ks of the so-called good time (Chandra ObsID 5429). It was observed again on 2005 March 8 starting at 17:43 UT for essentially the same duration (Chandra ObsID 5428). The ACIS was used in the nominal imaging array (chips I0-I3) which provides a field of view of approximately 17&apos; x 17&apos;. The aimpoint was at RA, Dec = 04:30:14.4, +35:16:22.2 (J2000.0) with a roll angle of 281 degrees. In addition, the S2 and S3 chips were active; however, the analysis of these data is not presented here. For purposes of point-source detection, the data from the two observations were merged into a single event list following established CIAO procedures to create a merged event list. To identify point sources, photons with energies below 300 eV and above 8.0 keV were filtered out from this merged event list. This excluded energies which generally lack a stellar contribution. By filtering the data as described, contributions from hard, non-stellar sources such as X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are attenuated, as is noise. A monochromatic exposure map was generated in the standard way using an energy of 1.49 keV which is a reasonable match to the expected peak energy of the stellar sources and the Chandra mirror transmission. The CIAO tool WavDetect was then run on a series of flux-corrected images binned by 1, 2, and 4 pixels. The output source lists were combined and this resulted in the detection of 231 sources. The authors defined false detections as any sources with &amp;amp;lt; 4 net counts or any sources more than 5&apos; off-axis with &amp;amp;lt; 7 net counts. By this definition, 18 of the 231 detections were rejected as false detections.

These are the brightest X-ray sources in the sky, but their position uncertainties and the sparse multi-wavelength coverage until now rendered the identification of their counterparts a demanding task with uncertain results. New all-sky multi-wavelength surveys of sufficient depth, like AllWISE and Gaia, and a new Bayesian statistics-based algorithm, NWAY, allow us, for the first time, to provide reliable counterpart associations. NWAY extends previous distance- and sky density-based association methods and, using one or more priors (e.g. colors, magnitudes), weights the probability that sources from two or more catalogs are simultaneously associated on the basis of their observable characteristics. Here, counterparts have been determined using a Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) color-magnitude prior. A reference sample of 4,524 XMM/Chandra and Swift X-ray sources demonstrates a reliability of 94.7 per cent for 2RXS sources. Combining the results of this work and of the matching of XMM-Newton Slew Survey, Version 2 (XMMSL2) sources also reported in this study (the results of the latter are available as the HEASARC&apos;s database table NWAYAWGXMM) with Chandra-COSMOS data, the authors propose a new separation between stars and AGN in the X-ray/WISE flux-magnitude plane, that is valid over six orders of magnitude. The authors also release the NWAY code and its user manual. NWAY was extensively tested with XMM-COSMOS data. Using two different sets of priors, the authors find an agreement of 96 per cent and 99 per cent with published Likelihood Ratio methods. Their results were achieved faster and without any follow-up visual inspection. With the advent of deep and wide area surveys in X-rays (e.g. SRG/eROSITA, Athena/WFI) and radio (ASKAP/EMU, LOFAR, APERTIF, etc.), NWAY will provide a powerful and reliable counterpart identification tool.

The goal of SOXS is to detect the relatively bright X-ray sources in the Orion A cloud and complete the census of more evolved YSOs in this region. These stars represent a sample of cloud members chosen with minimal a priori bias toward their IR properties. This XMM-Newton survey includes the Lynds 1641 (L1641) dark cloud, a region of the Orion A cloud with very few massive stars and hence a relatively low ambient UV flux, and the region around the O9 III star iota Orionis. In addition to proprietary data, the authors used archival XMM data of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) to extend their analysis to a major fraction of the Orion A cloud. They have detected 1060 X-ray sources with more than 4.5-sigma significance in L1641 and the iota Ori region. About 94% of the sources have Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) and Spitzer counterparts, 204 and 23 being Class II and Class I or protostar objects, respectively. In addition, the authors have identified 489 X-ray sources as counterparts to Class III candidates, given they are bright in X-rays and appear as normal photospheres at mid-IR wavelengths. The remaining 205 X-ray sources are likely distant active galactic nuclei (AGN) or other galactic sources not related to Orion A. The authors find that Class III candidates appear more concentrated in two main clusters in L1641. The first cluster of Class III stars is found toward the northern part of L1641, concentrated around iota Ori. The stars in this cluster are more evolved than those in the Orion Nebula. The authors estimate a distance of 300-320 pc for this cluster showing that it is in the foreground of the Orion A cloud. Another cluster rich in Class III stars is located in L1641 South and appears to be a slightly older cluster embedded in the Orion A cloud. Furthermore, other evolved Class III stars are found north of the ONC toward NGC 1977. The SOXS survey is composed of seven specifically proposed ~ 50 ks XMM-Newton fields, south of the ONC, to which the authors added four archival fields in the same region. The archival fields are centered on iota Orionis, V380 Ori, and V883 Ori, respectively (see Fig. 1 and Table 1 of the reference paper for more details of the X-ray observations). This HEASARC table contains the contents of Table 2 (1060 X-ray detected sources in the fields S1 - S10 listed in Table 1 of the reference paper), Table 3 (best-fit spectral parameters for the 232 brightest of these X-ray sources) and Table 4 (list of 1041 IR counterparts to the X-ray sources) from the reference paper. Some X-ray sources have no identified counterparts (16 of them in fact lie outside of the FOV of the Spitzer observations), most have a single counterpart, and a small number have 2 or even 3 IR counterparts within the 5 arcseconds matching radius used. For X-ray sources with more than 1 IR counterpart, we have added entries for the additional counterparts (71 in total), repeating the X-ray information in such cases. Thus, this HEASARC table contains 1131 (1060 + 71) entries corresponding to the 1060 X-ray source detections. To make its contents easier to visualize, the HEASARC has added a a parameter ir_match which lists the counterpart number for the entry: If there is no identified IR counterpart, ir_match is set to 0, for the first listed IR counterpart to 1, for the second and third, to 2 and 3, respectively. Thus, if the user wants to reduce the table back to a pure list of X-ray sources and their primary IR counterparts, they should search the table selecting ir_match &amp;amp;lt; 2.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=l1641ioxmm&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/l1641ioxmm.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

An automated algorithm was used to match a continuum to each quasar and to identify regions of flux at least 10% below the continuum over a velocity range of at least 1000 km/s in the C IV and Mg II absorption regions.

The authors characterize their sample through the traditional &apos;balnicity&apos; index BI and a revised absorption index AI, as well as through parameters such as the width, outflow velocity, fractional depth, and number of troughs. From a sample of 16,883 quasars at 1.7 &amp;amp;lt;= z &amp;amp;lt;= 4.38, they identify 4386 (26.0%) quasars with broad C IV absorption, of which 1756 (10.4%) satisfy traditional selection criteria.

The authors correlated these newly detected X-ray sources with earlier M 33 X-ray catalogs and information from optical, infra-red and radio wavelengths.

The X-ray cluster candidates were selected from the 2XMMi-DR3 catalog in the footprint of the SDSS-DR7. The authors developed a finding algorithm to search for overdensities of galaxies at the positions of the X-ray cluster candidates in the photometric redshift space and to measure the redshifts of the clusters from the SDSS data. For optically confirmed clusters with good quality X-ray data, they derived the X-ray flux, luminosity, and temperature from proper spectral fits, while the X-ray flux for clusters with low-quality X-ray data was obtained from the 2XMMi-DR3 catalogue. The detection algorithm provides the photometric redshift of 530 galaxy clusters. Of these, 310 clusters have a spectroscopic redshift for at least one member galaxy. About 75 percent of the optically confirmed cluster sample are newly discovered X-ray clusters. Moreover, 301 systems are known as optically selected clusters in the literature while the remainder are new discoveries in X-ray and optical bands. The optically confirmed cluster sample spans a wide redshift range 0.03 to 0.70 (median z = 0.32). In this paper, they present the catalog of X-ray-selected galaxy groups and clusters from the 2XMMi/SDSS galaxy cluster survey. The catalog has two subsamples: (i) a cluster sample comprising 345 objects with their X-ray spectroscopic temperature and flux from the spectral fitting; (these objects are identified by having values for the table_sample parameter of 1 in this HEASARC implementation of the catalog) and (ii) a cluster sample consisting of 185 systems with their X-ray flux from the 2XMMi-DR3 catalog, because their X-ray data are insufficient for spectral fitting (these objects are identified by having values for the table_sample parameter of 2 herein). For each cluster, the catalog also provides the X-ray bolometric luminosity and the cluster mass at R&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;500&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; based on scaling relations and the position of the likely brightest cluster galaxy (BCG).

In addition, the centers of the galaxies given by PGC2003 are not necessarily precise and the specific environments of the 1,809 sources are different. Therefore, the authors visually checked the Chandra and DSS images simultaneously, since two-band inspection can help to exclude the nuclear sources, bright knots, and extended sources. X-ray sources with clear DSS features would be dropped because, for a source with a visual magnitude &amp;amp;lt;20 and a distance &amp;amp;gt;30 Mpc, its absolute magnitude would be brighter than -12.4, which is beyond the limit of the brightest star clusters.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=vlulxcat&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/vlulxcat.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The large field of view of the Advanced Camera for Surveys/WFC, combined with the high resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope and Chandra, allow the authors to constrain the LMXB formation scenarios in elliptical galaxies. They confirm that NGC 1399 has the highest LMXB fraction in GCs of all nearby elliptical galaxies studied so far, even though the exact value depends on galactocentric distance due to the interplay of a differential GC versus galaxy light distribution and the GC color dependence. In fact, LMXBs are preferentially hosted by bright, red GCs out to &amp;amp;gt; 5 R&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;eff&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; of the galaxy light. The finding that GCs hosting LMXBs follow the radial distribution of their parent GC population argues against the hypothesis that the external dynamical influence of the galaxy affects the LMXB formation in GCs. On the other hand, field-LMXBs closely match the host galaxy light, thus indicating that they are originally formed in situ and not inside GCs. The authors measure GC structural parameters, finding that the LMXB formation likelihood is influenced independently by mass, metallicity, and GC structural parameters. In particular, the GC central density plays a major role in predicting which GCs host accreting binaries. Finally, this analysis shows that LMXBs in GCs are marginally brighter than those in the field, and in particular the only color-confirmed GC with L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt; 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;39&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg/s shows no variability, which may indicate a superposition of multiple LMXBs in these systems.

For the sake of completeness, the authors extracted the polarization information for seven extended sources from the 9-yr Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe co-added maps at 23 GHz. The full sample of 187 sources constitutes a ~ 99% complete sample of extragalactic sources brighter than S&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;20GHz&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; = 500 mJy at the selection epoch with Declination below -30&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;o&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;. The sample has a 91.4% detection rate in polarization at ~ 20 GHz (94% if considering the sub-sample of point-like sources). The authors have measurements also at 4.8 and 8.6 GHz within ~1 month of the 20-GHz observations for 172 sources so as to reconstruct the spectral properties of the sample in total intensity and in polarization: 143 of them have a polarization detection at all three frequencies. The authors find that there is no statistically significant evidence of a relationship either between the fraction of polarization and frequency or between the fraction of polarization and the total intensity flux density. This indicates that Faraday depolarization is not very important above 4.8 GHz and that the magnetic field is not substantially more ordered in the regions dominating the emission at higher frequencies (up to 20 GHz). The authors estimate the distribution of the polarization fraction and the polarized flux density source counts at ~20 GHz. The selection of the sample was based on the list of confirmed AT20G sources available at the epoch of these observations (2006 October). The authors selected all objects with flux density S&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;20GHz&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt; 500 mJy and Declination below -30&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;o&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, excluding the Galactic plane region (|b| &amp;amp;lt;= 1.5o^) and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) region (inside a circle of 5.5&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;o&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; radius centered at RA =05:23:34.7 and Dec=-69:45:22 in J2000.0 coordinates).

This survey overlaps previous observations at 8.5 GHz allowing them to investigate the radio spectral properties of microJansky sources to flux densities greater than 40 microJy (uJy) at 1.4 GHz and greater than 8 uJy at 8.5 GHz. A total of 371 sources have been catalogued at 1.4 GHz as part of a complete sample within 20 arcminutes of the HDF.

Of these sources, 1,130 are point-like sources detected with &amp;amp;gt;= 3-sigma confidence in at least one of three energy bands (0.5 - 10, 0.5 - 2, and 2 - 10 keV), five have extended emission, and the remainder are detected at low significance. Since most sources have too few counts to permit individual classification, they are divided into five spectral groups defined by their quantile properties. The authors analyze stacked spectra of X-ray sources within each group, in conjunction with their fluxes, variability, and infrared counterparts, to identify the dominant populations in this survey. They find that ~ 50% of their sources are foreground sources located within 1 - 2 kpc, which is consistent with expectations from previous surveys. Approximately 20% of sources are likely located in the proximity of the Scutum-Crux and near Norma arm, while 30% are more distant, in the proximity of the far Norma arm or beyond. The authors argue that a mixture of magnetic and non-magnetic cataclysmic variables dominates the Scutum-Crux and near Norma arms, while intermediate polars and high-mass stars (isolated or in binaries) dominate the far Norma arm. In the paper, they also present the cumulative number count distribution for sources in this survey that are detected in the hard energy band.

The widely different point-spread functions obtained in each exposure at each point in the field required a novel source detection method, because of the overlapping tiling strategy, which is described in a companion paper. This method produced reliable sources down to a 7-12 counts, as verified by the resulting log N-log S curve, with sub-arcsecond positions, enabling optical and infrared identifications of virtually all sources, as reported in a second companion paper.

These two catalogs were used as a base and matched against the AGK2 (Schorr &amp;amp;amp; Kohlschuetter 1951-58), Yale photographic zones (Yale Trans., Vols. 11-32), First Cape Photographic Catalogue (CPC1; Jackson &amp;amp;amp; Stoy 1954, 55, 58; Stoy 1966), Sydney Southern Star Catalogue (King &amp;amp;amp; Lomb 1983), Sydney Zone Catalogue -48 to -54 degrees (Eichhorn et al. 1983), 124 meridian circle catalogs, and catalogs of recent epochs, such as the Carlsberg Meridian Catalogue, La Palma (CAMC), USNO Zodiacal Zone Catalog (Douglass &amp;amp;amp; Harrington 1990), and the Perth 83 Catalogue (Harwood [1990]) to obtain as many input positions as possible. All positions were then reduced to the system of the FK4 (Fricke &amp;amp;amp; Kopff 1963) using a combination of the FK4, the FK4 Supplement as improved by H. Schwan of the Astronomisches Rechen-Institut in Heidelberg, and the International Reference Stars (IRS; Corbin 1991), then combined with the CPC2 and AGK3. The total number of input positions from which the ACRS was formed is 1,643,783. The original catalog is divided into two parts. Part 1 contains the stars having better observational histories and, therefore, more reliable positions and proper motions. This part constitutes 78 percent of the catalog; the mean errors of the proper motions are +/-0.47 arcsec per century and +/-0.46 arcsec per century in right ascension and declination, respectively. The stars in Part 2 have poor observational histories and consist mostly of objects for which only two catalog positions in one or both coordinates were available for computing the proper motions. Where accuracy is the primary consideration, only the stars in Part 1 should be used, while if the highest possible density is desired, the two parts should be combined. The ACRS was compiled at the U. S. Naval Observatory with the intention that it be used for new reductions of the Astrographic Catalogue (AC) plates. These plates are small in area (2 x 2 deg) and the IRS is not dense enough. Whereas the ACRS was compiled using the same techniques developed to produce the IRS, it became clear as the work progressed that the ACRS would have applications far beyond its original purpose. With accurate positions and proper motions rigorously reduced to both the FK4 and FK5 (Fricke et al. 1988) systems, it does more than simply replace the SAO. Rather, it provides the uniform system of reference stars that has been needed for many years by those who require densities greater than the IRS and with high accuracy over a wide range of epochs. It is intended that, as additional observations become available, stars will be migrated from Part 2 to Part 1, with the hope that eventually the ACRS will be complete in one part. Additional details concerning the compilation and properties of the ACRS can be found in Corbin &amp;amp;amp; Urban (1989) except that the star counts and errors given here supersede the ones given in 1989.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=acrs&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/acrs.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

This is achieved by matching the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) in the optical ugriz bands to the UKIRT Infrared Digital Sky Survey (UKIDSS) Large Area Survey (LAS) in the NIR YJHK bands. The authors match the ~1 million SDSS DR6 Photometric Quasar catalog to Data Release 3 of the UKIDSS LAS (ULAS) and produce a catalog with 130,827 objects with detections in one or more NIR bands, of which 74,351 objects have optical and K-band detections and 42,133 objects have the full nine-band photometry. The majority (~85%) of the SDSS objects were not matched simply because these were not covered by the ULAS. The positional standard deviation of the SDSS Quasar to ULAS matches is 0.1370 arcseconds in RA and 0.1314 arcseconds in Dec. The authors find an absolute systematic astrometric offset between the SDSS Quasar catalog and the UKIDSS LAS, of |RA offset| = 0.025 arcseconds and |Dec offset| = 0.040 arcseconds; they suggest the nature of this offset to be due to the matching of catalog, rather than image, level data.

It excludes 157,075 initial candidates that were culled as known or likely contaminants.

This sample extends the previous catalog (Paper I: Richards et al. 2004, ApJS, 155, 257) by using the latest SDSS public release data and probing both ultraviolet (UV)-excess and high-redshift quasars. While the addition of high-redshift candidates reduces the overall efficiency (quasars:quasar candidates) of the catalog to ~80%, it is expected to contain no fewer than 850,000 bona fide quasars, which is ~8 times the number of the previous sample and ~10 times the size of the largest spectroscopic quasar catalog. Cross-matching between this photometric catalog and spectroscopic quasar catalogs from both the SDSS and 2dF survey yields 88,879 spectroscopically confirmed quasars. For judicious selection of the most robust UV-excess sources (~500,000 objects in all), the efficiency is nearly 97 - more than sufficient for detailed statistical analyses. The catalog&apos;s completeness to type 1 (broad-line) quasars is expected to be no worse than 70%, with most missing objects occurring at z &amp;amp;lt; 0.7 and 2.5 &amp;amp;lt; z &amp;amp;lt; 3.0. In addition to classification information, the authors provide photometric redshift estimates (typically good to Delta(z) +/- 0.3 [2-sigma]) and cross-matching with radio, X-ray, and proper-motion catalogs. Finally, the authors have considered the catalog&apos;s utility for determining the optical luminosity function of quasars and are able to confirm the flattening of the bright-end slope of the quasar luminosity function at z ~ 4 as compared to z ~ 2.

The XMM-Newton observations were taken on 2003 July 3 with a total exposure time of ~45 ks for the EPIC-MOS cameras and ~42 ks for the European Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC) PN camera. The authors use only the data from the PN camera (with a thin optical blocking filter) because of its high sensitivity to soft X-rays in the study of diffuse emission and include the data from the MOS cameras in the analysis of X-1. The Chandra observation, taken on 2003 March 12 with an exposure of 29 ks and already described by Bauer and Brandt (2004, ApJ, 601, 67), was reprocessed by the authors using the then-latest CIAO software (version 3.2.1) and calibration database (version 3.0.0).

They cross-correlated the spatial positions of the objects in this catalog with their X-ray source positions, using a matching radius of 4 arcsec for XMM-Newton PN sources and 2 arcsec for Chandra ACIS sources. The radius was chosen to be greater than the 1-sigma statistical position uncertainty of almost all the sources.In no case is there a match with multiple 2MASS objects.

The galaxy overdensities within which X-ray sources reside show a positive recent redshift evolution (at least for the range studied; z &amp;amp;lt;~ 0.85). The authors also find that X-ray selected galaxies, when compared to AGN, inhabit significantly higher galaxy overdensities, although their spatial extent appear to be smaller than that of AGN. Hard AGN (harness ratios HR &amp;amp;gt;= -0.2) are located in more overdense regions than soft AGN (HR &amp;amp;lt; -0.2), which is clearly seen in both redshift ranges, although it appears to be stronger in the higher redshift range (0.55 &amp;amp;lt; z &amp;amp;lt; 0.85). Furthermore, the galaxy overdensities (with delta &amp;amp;gt; 1.5, where delta is defined in equation (3) of the reference paper) within which soft AGN are embedded appear to evolve more rapidly compared to the corresponding overdensities around hard AGN.

The field of view was square and 0.75 degrees x 0.75 degrees FWHM on each side. Each proportional counter consisted of an argon chamber on top of a xenon chamber separated by a 1.5 mm beryllium window. The fractional energy resolution, dE/E, was 21(E/6 keV)^-0.5 percent FWHM for the argon chambers. The output from each chamber was pulse height analyzed into 128 channels with the argon chambers sensitive from 1-20 keV and the xenon from 5-50 keV. To optimize the background subtraction, each half of the detector array was alternately offset to a source-free region of sky to monitor the particle background. Only results from the argon detectors are included in the EXOSAT ME database. The high count rates given by the ME required OBC (on board computer) programs to compress the data prior to their being telemetered. Depending on the objective of the observation the OBC programs traded time resolution against spectral information. Depending on the telemetry load, and the OBC programs running for the other two experiments, two or three ME programs could be run simultaneously. The spectral orientated programs gave spectra plus intensity profiles. The timing programs gave purely intensity profile data with in some cases selectable channels. The highest time resolution possible for a single selectable energy band was 0.2 ms. The products available within this database has been created using the data sampled by the spectral orientated OBC programs.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=me&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/me.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The authors investigated where new and previously-known sources detected by ISGRI fit in the parameter space of high-energy objects, and they used the parameters to test correlations expected from theoretical predictions.

The authors find good agreement between their redshift distribution and that predicted by the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) Simulated Skies project. They find no correlation between K-band magnitude and radio flux, but show that sources with 1.4-GHz flux densities below ~ 1 mJy are fainter in the near-infrared than brighter radio sources at the same redshift, and they discuss in their paper the implications of this result for spectroscopically incomplete samples where the K-z relation has been used to estimate redshifts. The authors use the infrared-radio correlation to separate their sample into radio-loud and radio-quiet objects and show that only radio-loud hosts have spectral energy distributions consistent with predominantly old stellar populations, although the fraction of objects displaying such properties is a decreasing function of radio luminosity. Many of the spectra presented in this study were obtained as part of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) program P074.A-0333, undertaken using the Visible Multi-Object Spectrograph (VIMOS) instrument on UT3/Melipal.

Archival NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) data at 1.4 GHz and observations at 5 GHz with the Very Large Array are used to characterize the sources.

After accounting for the number of active galactic nuclei and possible foreground stars among the detected X-ray sources, they estimate that 45-70 of the sources are cluster members. Four of the X-ray sources have previously been identified as accreting compact binaries in the cluster - three cataclysmic variables (CVs) and one quiescent neutron star. Correlating the Chandra positions with known variable stars yields 8 matches, of which 5 are probable cluster members that are likely to be binary stars with active coronae. Extrapolating these optical identifications to the remaining unidentified X-ray source population, the authors estimate that 20 - 35 of the sources are CVs and a similar number are active binaries. This likely represents most of the CVs in the cluster, but only a small fraction of all the active binaries.

In their paper, they explore the significance of these findings in the context of primordial versus dynamical channels for CV formation. They note that the number of CVs per unit mass in Omega Cen is at least 2 - 3 times lower than in the field, suggesting that primordial binaries that would otherwise lead to CVs are being destroyed in the cluster environment. The authors obtained 2 exposures of Omega Cen using the imaging array of the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS-I) on 2000 January 24 - 25, in &amp;amp;quot;very faint&amp;amp;quot; (VF) mode. The total exposure time was 72.4 ks. The authors determined source counts using 95% encircled energy radii as determined from model PSFs, derived using the CIAO tool mkpsf at an intermediate energy of ~ 1.5 keV (the PSF shape being somewhat energy dependent). Counts were extracted in three bands: &amp;amp;quot;soft&amp;amp;quot; (0.5 - 1.5 keV), &amp;amp;quot;medium&amp;amp;quot; (0.5 - 4.5 keV), and &amp;amp;quot;hard&amp;amp;quot; (1.5 - 6.0 keV). The authors determined the background to subtract from each source by dividing the image into 1 arcminute-wide annuli centered on the aim point in chip 3 (the innermost &amp;amp;quot;annulus&amp;amp;quot; being a circle of radius 1.5 arcminutes). Background values adopted for sources in a given annulus were averages determined from several source-free regions within that annulus, after verifying that the background levels were azimuthally symmetric. For 12 sources ( source_numbers 11b, 12b, 13e, 22c, 32c, 41b, 41c, 84a, 84b, 84c, 93a, and 93b) that fell in the chip gaps or near the outer edge of a chip, background regions were chosen specifically to reflect these conditions. Local background determinations were also made for a small number of sources to the west of the cluster center that lie on or near a large diffuse X-ray source ~7 arcminutes west of the cluster center (see below). Following background subtraction, the authors applied aperture corrections and also corrected for reduced effective exposure times off-axis and in the chip gaps using the exposure map.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=omegcencxo&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/omegcencxo.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The reduction and cataloging of radio sources are described in the reference paper. This table comprises the catalog of the sources detected above 5 sigma. The survey presented is the deepest so far in terms of the radio source density on the sky. Perhaps surprisingly, the sources down to the bottom of the catalog appear to have median angular sizes which are still greater than 1 arcsecond, like their cousins 10-100 times stronger. The shape of the differential log N-log S counts also seems to require a correction for the finite sizes of the sources in order to be self-consistent. If the log N-log S normalization remains constant at the lowest flux densities, there are about six sources per square arcminute at 15 microJy (uJy) at 20 cm. Given the finite-source size this implies that we may reach the natural confusion limit near 1 uJy. The observations were made with the VLA in A, B, C, and D configurations for a total of almost 140 hr on-source between 2001 December and 2004 January.

Since DIRBE had excellent temporal coverage (100-1900 independent measurements per object during the 10 month cryogenic mission in 1989 to 1990), the catalog also contains information about variability at each wavelength, including amplitudes of variation observed during the mission. Since the DIRBE spatial resolution is relatively poor (0.7 degrees), the authors carefully investigated the question of confusion, and flagged sources with infrared-bright companions within the DIRBE beam. In addition, they filtered the DIRBE light curves for data points affected by companions outside of the main DIRBE beam but within the `sky&apos; portion of the scan. At high Galactic latitudes (|b| &amp;amp;gt; 5 degrees), the catalog contains essentially all of the unconfused sources with flux densities greater than 90, 60, 60, 50, 90, and 165 Jy at 1.25, 2.2, 3.5, 4.9, 12, and 25 microns, respectively, corresponding to magnitude limits of approximately 3.1, 2.6, 1.7, 1.3, -1.3, and -3.5. At longer wavelengths and in the Galactic Plane, the completeness is less certain because of the large DIRBE beam and possible contributions from extended emission. For each source, for comparison, the names of the sources in other catalogs, their spectral types, variability types, IRAS and 2MASS photometry, SIMBAD spectral types and published variability types, and whether or not the sources are known OH/IR stars are also included. Unlike the IRAS and 2MASS Catalogs, the DIRBE Point Source Catalog was not constructed by searching the DIRBE database with a point source template and extracting sources based on S/N and confirmation criteria. The DIRBE Catalog was constructed using a target sample list obtained from other infrared catalogs. Since DIRBE is much less sensitive per scan than IRAS or 2MASS, essentially all of the point sources with high S/N light curves in the DIRBE database are already contained in IRAS, 2MASS, and/or MSX. Thus, for simplicity, the authors used these previous catalogs to select a sample for the DIRBE Point Source Catalog. Their initial sample included a total of 21,335 sources; the final catalog contains 11,788 sources. The initial sample was selected from the IRAS Point Source Catalog (1988), the 2MASS Point Source Catalog (Cutri 2003), and/or the MSX Point Source Catalog Version 1.2 (Egan et al. 1999, A&amp;amp;amp;A, 349, 236) that satisfied at least one of the following criteria: (a) 2MASS J magnitude &amp;amp;lt;= 4.51 (F&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;1.25&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt;= 25 Jy), (b) 2MASS K magnitude &amp;amp;lt;= 3.81 (F&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;2.2&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt;= 20 Jy), (c) IRAS or MSX F&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;12&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt;= 15 Jy, or (d) IRAS or MSX F&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;25&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt;= 27.5 Jy. The 1.25 and 2.2 micron limits are equal to the average 1-sigma sensitivity per scan in the raw DIRBE light curves of Smith et al. (2002, AJ, 123, 948), while the 12 and 25 micron limits are 0.5 times the average noise levels per scan in that study. These low limits were selected in order to avoid missing variable stars that may have been faint during the 2MASS, IRAS, or MSX mission and to improve the completeness at 3.5 and 4.9 micron. Since the filtering process improves the average per measurement uncertainty, a sensitive selection criterion is warranted to include as many sources as possible. There were 7872 sources with 2MASS J &amp;amp;lt;= 4.51, 20,492 sources with 2MASS K &amp;amp;lt;= 3.81, 4969 sources with IRAS F12 &amp;amp;gt;= 15 Jy, 40 sources in the MSX IRAS Gaps survey with MSX F12 &amp;amp;gt;= 15 Jy, 2753 sources with IRAS F25 &amp;amp;gt;= 27.5 Jy, and 18 sources in the MSX IRAS Gaps survey with MSX F25 &amp;amp;gt;= 27.5 Jy. Thus, the initial list is dominated by stars selected by the 2MASS criteria. These lists were merged together to make a single target list, containing 21,335 sources. To merge the 2MASS and IRAS/MSX lists, the authors used a 60 arcsecond matching radius. If more than one 2MASS source was within 60 arcseconds of the IRAS position, they assumed that the brightest K band source was the match. Note that the authors did not include sources in their input list based on their 60 and/or 100 micron IRAS flux densities, as extended emission from cirrus becomes more significant at these wavelengths. This means that the DIRBE Point Source Catalog is biased against very cold objects, such as galaxies and molecular clouds. Since the authors only used the point source catalogs of 2MASS, IRAS, and MSX for source selection, their sample is also biased against extended objects.

They have positionally matched their optical catalog with the list of X-ray sources found in a Chandra-ACIS observation of this cluster (Damiani et al. 2004, ApJ, 608, 781: available in Browse both via links from this table and also as the NGC6530CXO table), finding a total of 828 stars in common, 90% of which are pre-main sequence stars in NGC 6530. The data used in this work come from the combination of optical BVI images taken with the WFI camera made on 27-28 July 2000, a 60 ks Chandra ACIS X-ray observation, and public near-infrared data from the All-Sky Catalog of Point Sources of the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS, CDS Cat. &amp;amp;lt;II/24&amp;amp;gt;). The total number of optical sources falling in the Chandra FOV is 8956, while the Damiani et al. (2004, ApJ, 608, 781) Catalog contains 884 X-ray sources, who concluded that at least 90% of the X-ray sources are very probable cluster members. To cross-correlate the X-ray and optical catalogs, the authors used a matching distance of &amp;amp;lt; 4 sigmaX, where sigmaX is the the X-ray positional error, or 1.5&amp;amp;quot;, whichever is smaller, after a systematic shift between the X-ray and WFI positions of 0.2&amp;amp;quot; in RA and -0.26&amp;amp;quot; in Dec had been included. This resulted in a number of multiple identifications, among which 4 turned into unique identifications when a reduced distance of 1.5&amp;amp;quot; was used. This finally resulted in 721 single, 44 double, and 3 triple identifications in the optical catalog; in addition, one X-ray source has 4 optical identifications, and another has 6 optical identifications. The total number of X-ray sources with WFI counterparts is therefore 770; of them, only 15 X-ray identified stars come from the Sung et al.

In the reference paper, the authors present the log N-log S and spatial distributions of X-ray point sources in seven Galactic bulge (GB) fields within 4 degrees of the Galactic center (GC). They compare the properties of 1159 X-ray point sources discovered in their deep (100 ks) Chandra observations of three low extinction Window fields near the GC with the X-ray sources in the other GB fields centered around Sgr B2, Sgr C, the Arches Cluster, and Sgr A* using Chandra archival data. To reduce the systematic errors induced by the uncertain X-ray spectra of the sources coupled with field-and-distance-dependent extinction, they classify the X-ray sources using quantile analysis and estimate their fluxes accordingly. The result indicates that the GB X-ray population is highly concentrated at the center, more heavily than the stellar distribution models. It extends out to more than 1.4 degrees from the GC, and the projected density follows an empirical radial relation inversely proportional to the offset from the GC. They also compare the total X-ray and infrared surface brightness using the Chandra and Spitzer observations of the regions. The radial distribution of the total infrared surface brightness from the 3.6-micron band images appears to resemble the radial distribution of the X-ray point sources better than that predicted by the stellar distribution models. Assuming a simple power-law model for the X-ray spectra, the closer to the GC, the intrinsically harder the X-ray spectra appear, but adding an iron emission line at 6.7 keV in the model allows the spectra of the GB X-ray sources to be largely consistent across the region. This implies that the majority of these GB X-ray sources can be of the same or similar type. Their X-ray luminosity and spectral properties support the idea that the most likely candidate is magnetic cataclysmic variables (CVs), primarily intermediate polars (IPs). Their observed number density is also consistent with the majority being IPs, provided the relative CV to star density in the GB is not smaller than the value in the local solar neighborhood.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=champlanex&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/champlanex.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The full ChaMP catalog sample is 7 times larger than the initial published ChaMP catalog (Kim et al. 2004, ApJS, 150, 19). The exposure times of the fields in this sample range from 0.9 to 124 ks, corresponding to a deepest X-ray flux limit in the 0.5 - 8.0 keV band of 9 x 10^-16 ergs cm^-2 s^-1.

The ChaMP catalog includes X-ray photometric data in eight different energy bands as well as X-ray spectral hardness ratios and colors, source reliability, detection probability, and positional uncertainties. The false source detection rate is ~1% of all detected ChaMP sources, while the detection probability is better than ~ 95% for sources with counts &amp;amp;gt;~ 30 and off-axis angle &amp;amp;lt;5&apos;.

The main goal of the present work is to study the radio spectra of an unprecedentedly large sample of sources (~ 2000 observed, ~ 600 detected in both frequencies). This table contains the results from ancillary radio observations at a frequency of 2.3 GHz which were obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). It comprises the catalog of sources with measured 1.4 GHz to 2.3 GHz spectral indices (Table 2 in the reference paper), compiled in the framework of ATLAS. It comprises only such sources which have unambiguous detections at both 1.4 GHz and 2.3 GHz, so no upper or lower limits on the spectral index based on non-detections are included. The 2.3-GHz detection limit is 300 uJy (equivalent to 4.5 sigma in the ELAIS-S1 field and 4.0 sigma in the CDF-S). The authors compute spectral indices between 1.4 GHz and 2.3 GHz using matched-resolution images and investigate various properties of their source sample in their dependence on their spectral indices. The authors find the entire source sample to have a median spectral index of -0.74, in good agreement with both the canonical value of -0.7 for optically thin synchrotron radiation and other spectral index studies conducted by various groups. Regarding the radio spectral index Alpha as indicator for source type, they find only marginal correlations so that flat or inverted spectrum sources are usually powered by AGN and hence conclude that, at least for the faint population, the spectral index is not a strong discriminator. They investigate the z-Alpha relation for their source sample and find no such correlation between spectral index and redshift at all. The authors do find a significant correlation between redshift and radio to near-infrared flux ratio, making this a much stronger tracer of high-z radio sources. They also find no evidence for a dependence of the radio-IR correlation on spectral index.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=atlas2p3gh&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/atlas2p3gh.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

This survey will map out the locations of the extragalactic radio sources relative to the large scale structure as traced by the X-ray emission. This is of particular interest because radio galaxies and radio-loud AGN show strong and complex interactions with their small and larger scale environment, and different classes of radio galaxies are suggested to lie at different places with respect to the large scale structure. For the phase calibration of the radio data, the authors used standard self-calibration at 325 MHz and field-base calibration at 74 MHz. Polyhedron-based imaging as well as mosaicking methods were used at both frequencies. At 74 MHz, the resolution was 30 arcseconds, the median 5-sigma sensitivity was ~ 162 mJy/beam and 666 sources were detected over an area of 132 square degrees.

This table contains the complete version of the list of detections (2,526 entries), whereas the short &apos;high-confidence&apos; version (the HEASARC&apos;s &amp;amp;lt;a href=&quot;/W3Browse/rosat/rospspcf.html&quot;&amp;amp;gt;ROSPSPCF table&amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;gt;) contains 704 detections. The ROSPSPCFTOT table includes many questionable sources that meet the following parameter criteria: false_det = &apos;f&apos; or deferred = &apos;D&apos; or not_checked = &apos;n&apos;. See the documentation below for descriptions of these parameters. The catalog consists of all primary source parameters from the automated detection algorithm employed by the SASS. In addition each observation has been quality checked, both by automatic algorithms and by detailed visual inspection. The results of this quality checking are contained as a set of logical-value flags for a set of principal source parameters. If a source parameter is suspect, the associated flag is set to a corresponding alphabetical value; parameters with no obvious problems maintain the default, &apos;.&apos;, value. The Second ROSAT Pointed PSPC Filter Source Catalog includes missing sources, i.e. obvious sources which were not detected by the SASS source detection software but which could be easily detected by visual inspection. Missed sources are marked by negative values of their source identification number, i.e. the parameter &apos;MPLSX_ID&apos; has a negative value for these sources. The only tabulated quantities for these visually identified missed sources are source positions; other quantities (like count rates, hardness ratios, etc.) are not available. These data have been screened by ROSAT data centers in the US, Germany, and the UK as a step in the production of the ROSAT Results Archive.

The XMM-Newton observations, of a total duration of ~ 180 ks, reveal that NGC 6231 is very rich in the X-ray domain too. Indeed, 610 X-ray sources were detected in the present field of view, centered on the colliding wind binary HD 152248 in the cluster core (RA, Dec J2000.0 of 16 54 10.06, -41 49 30.1). The limiting sensitivity of this survey is approximately 6 x 10^-15^erg/s/cm^2 but clearly depends on the location in the field of view and on the source spectrum. Using different existing catalogs, over 85% of the X-ray sources could be associated with at least one optical and/or infrared counterpart within a limited cross-correlation radius of 2.5 or 3-arcsec according to the optical/IR catalog used. The surface density distribution of the X-ray sources presents a slight N-S elongation. Once corrected for the spatial sensitivity variation of the EPIC instruments, the radial profile of the source surface density is well described by a King profile with a central density of about 8 sources per arcmin^2 and a core radius close to 3.1 arcminutes. The distribution of the X-ray sources seems closely related to the optical source distribution. The expected number of foreground and background sources should represent about 9% of the detected sources, thus strongly suggesting that most of the observed X-ray emitters are physically belonging to NGC 6231. Finally, beside a few bright but soft objects -- corresponding to the early-type stars of the cluster -- most of the sources are relatively faint (~5 x 10^-15 erg/s/cm^2) with an energy distribution peaked around 1.0 - 2.0 keV. The catalog of the 610 X-ray sources detected in the 30&apos;-diameter field of view of XMM-Newton is presented here, including the equatorial coordinates, logarithmic likelihoods and count rates for the three EPIC instruments and for various energy ranges, as well as the cross-identification of the X-ray sources with various optical/infrared catalogs (2MASS, GSC2.2, USNO B1.0, SSB06) and their most commonly used names (HD/HDE, CD, CPD, Segg., SBL98, Braes), with only the closest identifications being reported here.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=ngc6231xmm&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/ngc6231xmm.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

About 95% of these are expected to be cluster members, most lower mass pre-main-sequence stars. Extrapolating to low X-ray levels, the total stellar population is estimated to be 20,000 - 30,000 pre-main-sequence stars.

The heavily obscured clusters are mostly associated with previously known far-infrared sources and radio H II regions. The lightly obscured clusters are mostly newly identified in the X-ray images.

Robust optical identifications are provided for 90 per cent of the sources, and suggested identifications are presented for all but 14 (of which seven are optically blank, and seven are close to bright contaminating objects). The authors show that the optical properties of the radio sources do not change with flux density, suggesting that active galactic nuclei (AGN) continue to contribute significantly at faint flux densities. they test this assertion by cross-correlating their radio catalog with the X-ray source catalog and conclude that radio-quiet AGN become a significant population at flux densities below 300 uJy, and may dominate the population responsible for the flattening of the radio source counts if a significant fraction of them are Compton-thick.

Nearly all radio galaxies with z &amp;amp;gt; 3 have been found using this redshift-spectral index correlation. The authors have started a program with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) to exploit this correlation at flux density levels about 10 to 100 times deeper than the known high-redshift radio galaxies which were identified primarily using the already available radio catalogs. In their program, they have obtained deep, high-resolution radio observations at 150 MHz with the GMRT for several &amp;amp;quot;deep&amp;amp;quot; fields which are well studied at higher radio frequencies and in other bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, with the aim to detect candidate high-redshift radio galaxies. In their paper, they present results from the deep 150-MHz observations of the LBDS (Leiden-Berkeley Deep Survey) Lynx field, which has been already imaged at 327, 610 and 1412 MHz with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) and at 1400 and 4860 MHz with the Very Large Array (VLA). The counterparts for the 150-MHz sources at higher radio frequencies were searched within a 20-arcsec radius from the 150-MHz position. The 150-MHz image made with the GMRT has an rms noise of ~ 0.7 mJy beam&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; and a resolution of ~ 19 x 15 arcsec&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;. It is the deepest low-frequency image of the LBDS-Lynx field. The source catalog of this field at 150 MHz has 765 sources down to ~ 20% of the primary beam response, covering an area of about 15 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;. The spectral index was estimated by cross-correlating each source detected at 150 MHz with the available observations at 327, 610, 1400 and 4860 MHz and also using available radio surveys such as the Westerbork Northern Sky Survey (WENSS) at 327 MHz and the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm (FIRST) survey at 1400 MHz. A total of 639 sources out of 765 (83%) have spectral indices determined. The remaining 17% of the sources are mostly weak radio sources with a median flux density of ~ 9 mJy, or fall in the regions where deep observations at higher frequencies do not exist. The median spectral index of the sample is 0.78. The authors find about 150 radio sources with spectra steeper than 1. About two-thirds of these are not detected in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), hence are strong candidate high-redshift radio galaxies, which need to be further explored with deep infrared imaging and spectroscopy to estimate the redshift. The list of the 98 such steep-spectrum sources lacking SDSS counterparts is given in Table 4 of the published paper.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=gmrtlbdsly&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/gmrtlbdsly.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

Indeed, the distribution of pointlike X-ray sources appears nonuniform and concentrated broadly within the extent of the TeV source region.

The authors investigate the X-ray properties of NGC 1893, a young cluster (~ 1 - 2 Myr) in the outer part of the Galaxy (galactic radius &amp;amp;gt;= 11 kpc), where they expect differences in the disk evolution and in the mass distribution of the stars, so as to explore the X-ray emission of its members and compare it with that of young stars in star forming regions near to the Sun. The authors analyze 5 deep Chandra ACIS-I observations with a total exposure time of 450 ks. Source events of the 1021 X-ray sources have been extracted with the IDL-based routine ACIS-Extract. Using spectral fitting and quantile analysis of X-ray spectra, they derive X-ray luminosities and compare the respective properties of Class II and Class III members. They also evaluate the variability of sources using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and identify flares in the lightcurves. The X-ray luminosity of NGC 1893 X-ray members is in the range 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;29.5&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; - 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;31.5&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;. Diskless stars are brighter in X-rays than disk-bearing stars, given the same bolometric luminosity. The authors find that 34% of the 1021 lightcurves appear variable and that they show 0.16 flares per source, on the average. Comparing their results with those relative to the Orion Nebula Cluster, they find that, after accounting for observational biases, the X-ray properties of NGC 1893 and the Orion stars are very similar. The authors conclude that the X-ray properties of stars in NGC 1893 are not affected by the environment and that the stellar population in the outer Galaxy may have the same coronal properties as nearby star-forming regions. The X-ray luminosity properties and the X-ray luminosity function appear to be universal and can therefore be used for estimating distances and for determining stellar properties.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=ngc1893cxo&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/ngc1893cxo.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The goal of the OPTX Project is to use this survey, together with the Chandra Deep Field-North (CDF-N) and the Chandra Lockman Area North Survey (CLANS), which are among the most spectroscopically complete surveys to date, to analyze the effect of spectral type on the shape and evolution of the X-ray luminosity functions and to compare the optical spectral types with the X-ray spectral properties. The CLANS and CLASXS surveys bridge the gap between the ultra-deep pencil-beam surveys, such as the Chandra Deep Fields, and the shallower, very large-area surveys.

Due to its high obscuration, this is a poorly studied stellar cluster with only a handful of bright stars visible in the optical band, including three OB stars identified as primary excitation sources. The authors detect 225 X-ray sources, of which 85% are confidently identified as young stellar members of the region. Two potential distances of the cluster, 260 pc and 600 pc, are used in the paper. Supposing the X-ray luminosity function of SFRs to be universal, it supports a 600 pc distance as a lower limit for W40 and a total population of at least 600 stars down to 0.1 M&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;sun&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; under the assumption of a coeval population with a uniform obscuration.

The observations, data reduction and source count analysis are presented in the reference paper, along with a description of the overall scientific objectives. A catalog containing 462 sources detected with a resolution of 17.0 arcsecs by 15.5 arcsecs is presented. The differential source counts calculated from the WSRT data have been compared with those from the shallow VLA-NEP survey of Kollgaard et al.

The combination of these data sets, along with the deep nature of the radio observations will allow unique studies of a large range of topics including the redshift evolution of the luminosity function of radio sources, the clustering environment of radio galaxies, the nature of obscured radio-loud active galactic nuclei, and the radio/far-infrared correlation for distant galaxies.

They find the radio population at 20 GHz to be dominated by compact AGNs constituting 77% of the total sources in the AT20G. In the paper, they introduce the visibility-spectra diagnostic plot, produced using the AT20G cross-matches with lower frequency radio surveys at 1 GHz [the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS: Condon et al. 1998, AJ, 115, 1693) and the Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey (SUMSS: Mauch et al. 2003, MNRAS, 342, 1117)], that separates the 20-GHz population into distinct sub-populations of the compact AGNs, the compact steep-spectrum (CSS) sources, the extended AGN-powered sources and extended flat-spectrum sources. The extended flat-spectrum sources include a local thermal emitting population of high-latitude planetary nebulae and also gravitational lens and binary black hole candidates among the AGNs. The authors find a smooth transition in properties between the CSS sources and the AGN populations. The visibility catalog, together with the main AT20G survey, provides an estimate of angular size scales for sources in the AT20G and an estimate of the flux arising from central cores of extended radio sources.

This table contains results from a detailed X-ray spectral analysis of the AGN belonging to the XMM-Newton Bright Serendipitous Survey (XBS, the HEASARC Browse XMMBSS table, CDS Cat. IX/41).

Regarding the shape of the average spectra, they find that it is best reproduced by a combination of an unabsorbed (absorbed) power law, a narrow Fe K-alpha emission line and a small (large) amount of reflection for unabsorbed (absorbed) sources.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=xmmbssagn&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/xmmbssagn.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The authors have estimated &apos;photometric redshifts&apos; for the identified sources, calibrating their method using ~200 galaxies in the fields with spectroscopic redshifts.

The catalogs in Paper II supersede the catalog from the first paper in this series (Paper I: Pierre et al. 2007, MNRAS, 382, 279, available at the HEASARC as the XMMLSS table) pertaining to the initial 5 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;.

The authors therefore have increased the number of identifications in this field by a factor close to 5. Galactic stellar sources represent about 15% of the total (74/487). About 54% (265/487) are broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) spanning redshifts between 0.15 and 3.87 with a median value of 1.68. The optical-to-X-ray spectral index (alpha_ox) of the broad-line AGN is 1.47 +/- 0.03, typical of optically selected type I quasars, and is found to correlate with the rest-frame X-ray and optical monochromatic luminosities at 2 keV and 2500 Angstroms, respectively. Consistent with previous studies, the authors find that alpha_ox is not correlated with z. In addition, 32 and 116 X-ray sources are, respectively, absorption- and emission-line galaxies at z &amp;amp;lt; 0.76. From a line ratio diagnostic diagram, it is found that in about 50% of these emission-line galaxies, the emission lines are powered significantly by the AGN. 30 of the XMM sources are detected at one or more radio frequencies (see Table 5 in the published paper). In addition, 24 sources (listed in table 4 of the published paper) have ambiguous identification: in eight cases, two XMM sources have a single optical source within 6 arcsec of each of them, whereas two and 14 XMM sources have, respectively, three and two possible optical sources within 6 arcsec of each of them.

The source surface density of 16.9 +/- 6.4 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; at the survey limit corresponds to a resolved fraction of the 5 - 10 keV X-ray background (XRB) of the order of 20-30 per cent. Hardness ratio analysis indicates that the spectra of a substantial fraction of the HELLAS sources (at least one-third) are harder than a alpha&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;E&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; = 0.6 power law. This hardness may be caused by large absorbing columns. The hardness ratio analysis also indicates that many HELLAS sources may have a spectrum more complex than a single absorbed power law. A soft component, superimposed on a strongly cut-off power law, is likely to be present in several sources. There is no overlap among the 142 fields used and, wherever possible, multiple observations of the same field have been merged in one single pointing to increase the sensitivity. Fields were selected among public data (such as that of March 1999) and the authors&apos; proprietary data. Fields centered on bright extended sources and bright Galactic sources were excluded from the survey, as were fields close to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and M 33. Most of the fields have exposures between 30 and 100 ks, and 20 fields have an exposure higher than 80 ks (see Fig. 1 of reference paper).

The main aim of the Chandra observations was to provide arcsecond, or better, positions, and hence reliable identifications, for the XMM-Newton sources. The ACIS-I observations were arranged in a mosaic of four 30-ks pointings, covering almost all of the 15-arcminute radius XMM-Newton/ROSAT field. 214 Chandra sources were detected above a Cash likelihood statistic of 25, which approximates to a 5-sigma significance, to a limiting flux of ~ 1.3 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-15&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;erg/cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;/s (0.5 - 7 keV).

The very large majority of the Chandra sources have an optical counterpart, with the distribution peaking at 23 &amp;amp;lt; R &amp;amp;lt; 24, although 14 have no counterpart to R = 27. The fraction of X-ray sources with no identification brighter than R = 27 is similar to that found in deeper Chandra surveys. The majority of the identifications are with galaxies. As found in other Chandra surveys, there is a very wide range of optical magnitudes for a given X-ray flux, implying a range of emission mechanisms, and many sources have high L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;/L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;opt&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ratios, implying absorption at moderate redshift.

The WMAP 9-Year Point Source Catalog contained herein has information on point sources in five frequency bands from 23 to 94 GHz, based on data from the entire 9 years of the WMAP sky survey from 10 Aug 2001 0:00 UT to 10 Aug 2010 0:00 UT, inclusive. The 5-band search technique used in the first-year, 3-year, 5-year and 7-year analyses now finds 501 point sources, compared to 471 point sources found in the 7-year analysis and 390 sources found in the 5-year analysis. The 5-band search method is largely unchanged from the 7-year analysis (Gold et al. 2011, ApJS, 192, 15). This method searches for point sources in each of the five WMAP wavelength bands. The nine-year signal-to-noise ratio map in each band is filtered in harmonic space by b&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;l&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;/[(b&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;l&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;)&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; C&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;l&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;(cmb) + C&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;l&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;(noise)], where b&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;l&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; is the transfer function of the WMAP beam response, C&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;l&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;(cmb) is the CMB angular power spectrum, and C&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;l&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;(noise) is the noise power. The filtering suppresses CMB and Galactic foreground fluctuations relative to point sources. For each peak in the filtered maps that is &amp;amp;gt; 5 sigma in any band, the unfiltered temperature map in each band is fit with the sum of a planar base level and a beam template formed by convolving an azimuthally symmetrized beam profile with a skymap pixel. (This method was previously used by Weiland et al. (2011, ApJS, 192, 19) for selected celestial calibration sources and is more accurate than the Gaussian fitting that was used for the seven-year and earlier point source analyses). The peak temperature from each beam template fit is converted to a source flux density using the conversion factor Gamma given in Table 3 of the reference paper. The flux density uncertainty is calculated from the 1-sigma uncertainty in the peak temperature, and does not include any additional uncertainty due to Eddington bias. Flux density values are entered into the catalog for bands where they exceed 2 sigma and where the source width from an initial Gaussian fit is within a factor of two of the beam width. A point source catalog mask is used to exclude sources in the Galactic plane and Magellanic cloud regions. This mask has changed from the seven-year analysis in accordance with changes in the KQ85 temperature analysis mask. A map pixel is outside of the nine-year point source catalog mask if it is either outside of the diffuse component of the nine-year KQ85 temperature analysis mask or outside of the seven-year point source catalog mask. The present mask admits 83% of the sky, compared to 82% and 78% for the previous 7-year and 5-year versions, respectively. The authors identify possible 5-GHz counterparts to the WMAP sources found by cross-correlating with the GB6 (Gregory et al. 1996, ApJS, 103, 427), PMN (Griffith et al. 1994, ApJS, 90, 179; Griffith et al. 1995, ApJS, 97, 347; Wright et al. 1994, ApJS, 94, 111; Wright et al. 1996, ApJS, 103, 145), Kuehr et al. (1981, A&amp;amp;amp;AS, 45, 367), and Healey et al. (2009, AJ, 138, 1032) catalogs. A 5-GHz source is identified as a counterpart if it lies within 11 arcminutes of the WMAP source position (the mean WMAP source position uncertainty is 4 arcminutes). When two or more 5 GHz sources are within 11 arcminutes, the brightest is assumed to be the counterpart and a multiple identification flag is entered in the catalog. A separate 9-year CMB-free Point Source Catalog (available in Browse as the &amp;amp;lt;a href=&quot;/W3Browse/wmap/wmapcmbfps.html&quot;&amp;amp;gt;WMAPCMBFPS&amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;gt; table) has information on point sources in three frequency bands from 41 to 94 GHz: the CMB-free method identified 502 point sources in a linear combination map formed from 41, 61 and 94 GHz band maps using weights such that CMB fluctuations are removed and flat-spectrum point sources are retained. The two catalogs have 387 sources in common. As noted by Gold et al. (2011, ApJS, 192, 15), differences in the source populations detected by the two search methods are largely caused by Eddington bias in the five-band source detections due to CMB fluctuations and noise. At low flux levels, the five-band method tends to detect point sources located on positive CMB fluctuations and to overestimate their fluxes, and it tends to miss sources located in negative CMB fluctuations. Other point source detection methods have been applied to WMAP data and have identified sources not found by our methods (e.g., Scodeller et al. (2012, ApJ, 753, 27); Lanz (2012, ADASS 7); Ramos et al. (2011, A&amp;amp;amp;A, 528, A75), and references therein).

However, the results for only a few objects or clusters have until now been reported and there has been no large survey comparable to that based upon the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS). A limited survey of X-ray sources, consisting of all public XMM observations (2XMMi) and slew survey data (XMMSL1), is now available. The X-ray counterparts to hot, massive stars have been searched for in these catalogs. About 300 OB stars were detected with XMM. Half of them were bright enough for a spectral analysis to be possible, and we make available the detailed spectral properties that were derived. The X-ray spectra of O stars are represented well by low (&amp;amp;lt; 1 keV) temperature components and seem to indicate that an absorption column is present in addition to the interstellar contribution. The X-ray fluxes are well correlated with the bolometric fluxes, with a scatter comparable to that of the RASS studies and thus larger than found previously with XMM for some individual clusters. These results contrast with those of B stars that exhibit a large scatter in the L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; - L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;bol&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; relation, no additional absorption being found, and the fits indicate a plasma at higher temperatures. Variability (either within one exposure or between multiple exposures) was also investigated whenever possible: short-term variations are far more rare than long-term ones (the former affects a few percent of the sample, while the latter concerns between one third and two thirds of the sources). This is a catalog of X-ray emitters amongst early-type stars following a correlation between the Reed (2003, AJ, 125, 2531) Catalog of galactic OB Stars and the 2XMMi Catalog (Watson et al. 2009, A&amp;amp;amp;A, 493, 339).

Here, the first results from the survey, carried out using the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager (AMI) Large Array (LA) at an observing frequency of 15.7 GHz, are presented. The survey fields cover an area of ~ 27 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; to a flux-density completeness of 1 mJy. Results for some deeper areas, covering ~ 12 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, which are wholly contained within the total areas and complete to 0.5 mJy, are also presented. The completeness for both areas is estimated to be at least 93 per cent. The 10C survey is the deepest radio survey of any significant extent (&amp;amp;gt;~ 0.2 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;) above 1.4 GHz.

The source catalog has been combined with that of the Ninth Cambridge Survey to calculate the 15.7-GHz source counts. A broken power law is found to provide a good parametrization of the differential count between 0.5 mJy and 1 Jy. The measured source count has been compared with that predicted by de Zotti et al. (2005, A&amp;amp;amp;A, 431, 893, and the model is found to display good agreement with the data at the highest flux densities. However, over the entire flux-density range of the measured count (0.5 mJy to 1 Jy), the model is found to underpredict the integrated count by ~ 30 per cent. Entries from the source catalog have been matched with those contained in the catalogues of the NRAO VLA Sky Survey and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm survey (both of which have observing frequencies of 1.4 GHz). This matching provides evidence for a shift in the typical 1.4-GHz spectral index to 15.7-GHz spectral index of the 15.7-GHz-selected source population with decreasing flux density towards sub-mJy levels - the spectra tend to become less steep. Automated methods for detecting extended sources, developed in Paper I, have been applied to the data; ~ 5 per cent of the sources are found to be extended relative to the LA-synthesized beam of ~ 30 arcsec. Investigations using higher resolution data showed that most of the genuinely extended sources at 15.7 GHz are classical doubles, although some nearby galaxies and twin-jet sources were also identified.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=ami10c15gz&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/ami10c15gz.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

In the reference paper, the authors extend the X-ray luminosity distribution (XLD) of the Alpha Persei cluster for M dwarfs, to add to the XLD found for hotter dwarfs from spatially extensive surveys of the whole cluster by ROSAT. Some of the hotter stars are identified as a background, possible slightly older group of stars at a distance of approximately 500 pc.

Twenty-three overlapping synthesis fields were observed in the Galactic Latitude b band of |b| &amp;amp;lt; 1.6 degrees. Each field was observed at two epochs, several years apart, to identify variable sources. Intensity data from the separate epochs were combined, and the resulting images mosaicked to produce a single image of the entire survey region. The sensitivity of the mosaic is typically a few mJy, corresponding to a detection level as low as 10 mJy/beam. The spatial resolution is 1&apos; by 1&apos; * cosec(Dec). The survey image provided the first high resolution view of the Galaxy at low radio frequencies, and included sections of the Sagittarius and Cygnus arms. These sections contain numerous extended features, among them supernova remnants, H II regions, &amp;amp;quot;bubbles&amp;amp;quot; of thermal emission, and large patches of amorphous galactic thermal emission. The inter-arm region is characterized by lower densities of extended features, but numerous discrete compact radio sources, most of which are background objects such as quasars and other types of active galactic nuclei. However, the resolution, sensitivity and low frequency of this survey make it ideal for detecting weak, non-thermal compact galactic sources, e.g. compact, low surface brightness SNRs and radio stars. Inspection of the survey image has produced a catalog of nearly 4000 discrete sources with sizes of less than about 3&apos;. Gaussian model parameters for each compact source in the mosaicked images were obtained using the AIPS routine IMFIT. The background-removed intensity distribution of each source was fitted by a 2-dimensional Gaussian, parametrized by the source position, peak intensity, major and minor axes, and the position angle of the major axis. The catalog contains all sources having peak intensity &amp;amp;gt; 5 times the rms noise level measured in the surrounding area of the image, and lists RA, Dec, flux density, and, if the source is resolved, the deconvolved major and minor axis and the position angle of the source. Sources were identified based on visual inspection of the images. In practice, a source had to have dimensions of less than a few arcminutes to be classified as a compact source. Most (85%) of the sources are either unresolved or only slightly resolved (major axis &amp;amp;lt; 60&amp;amp;quot;), but some sources have dimensions as large as 6&apos;. A source was considered resolved if the area of its Gaussian model was greater than the area of the beam by more than 4 times its uncertainty. Approximately 15% of the sources are resolved, with dimensions of 1&apos;- 3&apos;. The spatial distribution of resolved sources shows concentrations toward the spiral arms and follows the warping of the Galactic disk over the length of the survey region, indicating that a sizable fraction is Galactic. In the reference paper, spectral indices are calculated for 1313 sources detected in other radio surveys at frequencies greater than 408 MHz. The resolved sources exhibit a bimodal spectral index distribution, with distinct non-thermal and thermal populations. Comparison with the IRAS Point Source Catalogue results in 118 identifications between WSRT and IRAS sources, which are listed in Table 1 of the reference paper. Most of these are thermal radio sources associated with compact Galactic objects such as H II regions and planetary nebulae. A search for variability among 2148 of the compact sources has resulted in 29 candidate low-frequency variable sources, which are listed in Table 2 of the reference paper.

They used optical variability, among other more standard methods, as a means of identifying a large number of ROSAT All- Sky Survey sources. All objects fainter than about 12th magnitude and brighter than about 17th magnitude in or near the error circle of the ROSAT positions were tested for optical variability on hundreds of archival plates of the Sonneberg field patrol. The reference paper contains probable optical identifications of altogether 256 of the 370 ROSAT sources analyzed. In particular, the authors found 126 active galactic nuclei (some of them may be misclassified cataclysmic variables, CVs), 17 likely clusters of galaxies, 16 eruptive double stars (mostly CVs), 43 chromospherically active stars, 65 stars brighter than about 13th magnitude, 7 UV Ceti stars, 3 semi-regular or slow irregular variable stars of late spectral type, 2 DA white dwarfs, 1 Am star, 1 supernova remnant, and 1 planetary nebula. As expected, nearly all active galactic nuclei are found in the high-galactic latitude field, while the majority of CVs is located at low galactic latitudes. The authors identify in total 72 new variable objects. X-ray emission is, not unexpectedly, tightly correlated with optical variability, and thus their new method for optically identifying X-ray sources is demonstrated to be feasible. Given the large number of optical plates used, this method was most likely not more efficient than, for example, optical spectroscopy. However, it required no telescope time, only access to archival data. This table contains the X-ray properties of the 370 ROSAT point sources found by the authors in the 2 fields that they examined above a maximum likelihood threshold of 8.

The analysis challenges posed by ChASeM33 and the techniques adopted to address these challenges are discussed. To constrain the nature of the detected X-ray source, hardness ratios were constructed and spectra were fit for 254 sources, follow-up Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT) spectra of 116 sources were acquired, and cross-correlations with previous X-ray catalogs and other multi-wavelength data were generated. Based on this effort, 183 of the 662 ChASeM33 sources could be identified. Finally, in the reference paper, the luminosity function (LF) for the detected point sources as well as the one for the X-ray binaries (XRBs) in M33 were presented. The LFs in the soft band (0.5-2.0 keV) and the hard band (2.0-8.0 keV) have a limiting luminosity at the 90% completeness limit of 4.0 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;34&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; and 1.6 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;35&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; (for an assumed distance D to M33 of 817 kpc), respectively, which is significantly lower than what was reported by previous XRB population studies in galaxies more distant than M33.

Since the OM records data simultaneously with the X-ray telescopes on XMM-Newton, it typically produces images in one or more near-UV/optical bands for every pointing of the observatory. As of the beginning of 2014, the data in the public archive covered roughly 0.5% of the sky in 3425 fields. The OMCat is not dominated by sources previously undetected at other wavelengths; the bulk of objects have optical counterparts. However, the OMCat can be used to extend optical or X-ray spectral energy distributions for known objects into the ultraviolet, to study at higher angular resolution objects detected with GALEX, or to find high-Galactic-latitude objects of interest for UV spectroscopy. Differences between the current OMCat and the previous version of the OMCat (which was designated as XMMOMOBJ) are improved coordinates, improved quality flags, and a reduced number of spurious sources. The OM reduction was done with the standard ESAS software, with post-processing to apply the coordinate corrections in a more consistent manner. There is a major change in the way the data are represented in the table. In the previous XMMOMOBJ table a separate row was generated for each filter. In the current XMMOMCAT table each observation of each object generates only a single row regardless of how many filters were used. Unused filters have nulls while filters where the object is not detected have nulls for the detection parameters but a non-zero value for exposure. The table includes information for each filter and averaged information for the object as a whole. Only filters in which the object was detected are used in the averages. The parameters in this table comprise two sets: parameters describing the detection overall including id&apos;s and mean values, and values specific to the individual bands. There are three possible situations for the band data: (1) If there was no exposure in that band, then all fields for that band will be null. (2) If there was some exposure in the band but the object was not detected in that band, then the exposure field will give the actual exposure, but all of the other fields for that band will be null. (3) If the object was detected, then all of the fields for the band should be filled in. The filters included are V, B, U, UVW1, UVM2, UVW2 and white (i.e., unfiltered).</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=xmmomcat&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/xmmomcat.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

During the X-ray observations, the XMM-Newton Optical Monitor (XMM-OM) targeted the central 17 x 17 arcmin&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; region of the X-ray field of view, providing simultaneous optical/UV coverage of the CDFS. The resulting set of data can be taken into account to build an XMM-OM catalog of the CDFS, filling the UV spectral coverage between the optical surveys and GALEX observations. This table contains the UV catalog of the XMM-CDFS Deep Survey. Its main purpose is to provide complementary UV average photometric measurements of known optical/UV sources in the CDFS, taking advantage of the unique characteristics of the survey. The data reduction is intended also to improve the standard source detection on individual observations, by cataloguing faint sources through the stacking of their exposure images. The authors reprocessed the XMM-OM data of the survey and stacked the exposures from consecutive observations using the standard SAS tools to process the data obtained during single observations. Average measurements of detections with SAS good quality flags from individual observations and from stacked images have been joined to compile the catalogue. Sources have been validated through the cross-identification within the ESO Imaging Survey (EIS: Arnouts et al. 2001, A&amp;amp;amp;A, 379, 740) and COMBO-17 (Wolf et al. 2004, A&amp;amp;amp;A, 421, 913; 2008, A&amp;amp;amp;A, 492, 933) surveys. Photometric data of 1129 CDFS sources are provided in the main catalog, and optical/UV/X-ray photometric and spectroscopic information from other surveys are also included. The stacking extends the detection limits by ~1 mag in the three UV bands, contributing 30% of the catalogued UV sources. The comparison with the available measurements in similar spectral bands confirms the validity of the XMM-OM calibration.

The authors extract spectra and derive fluxes from power-law fits for 398 sources with more than 40 counts in the 0.5-8 keV band. They compare the best-fit fluxes with those in the catalog, which were obtained assuming a common photon index Gamma of 1.7; the authors find no bulk difference between the fluxes, and a moderate dispersion s of 0.33 dex. Using wherever possible the fluxes from the spectral fits, the authors derive the 2-10 keV Log N-Log S distribution, which is consistent with a Euclidean distribution. Finally, they release the computer code for the tools which they developed for this project. Sources were detected with a two-stage process. With the first pass at low significance, the authors got a list of candidate detections; and on the second pass they raised the significance threshold and derived accurate source parameters. Between the two passes, and because the second pass needs an input catalog, they identified the sources detected in more than one band. In the first pass, the SAS wavelet detection program ewavelet was run separately on each of the 0.5-2, 2-8 and 0.5-8 keV images of the entire mosaic, with a significance threshold of 4 sigma and the default wavelet scales (minimum 2 pixels, maximum 8 pixels, with a pixel size of 4). All parameters in this catalog which were derived from ewavelet have been given a prefix of &apos;wav&apos; in this HEASARC representation so as to distinguish them from the parameters derived using EMLDetect. In the second pass, the authors used the SAS EMLDetect program to validate the detections, refine the coordinates and obtain maximum-likelihood estimates of the source counts, count rates and fluxes. The EMLDetect minimum likelihood was set at L = 4.6, as in Ranalli et al.

Together with the 4-sigma threshold for ewavelet, for the final catalog this yields a joint significance between 4 sigma and 5 sigma, but which cannot be further constrained without simulations.

This catalog lists over 2200 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Selection of GRBs for the GUSBAD Catalog requires a 5-sigma excess over the background in two of the BATSE detectors over the energy range 50-300 keV. The search covers the entire mission except when CGRO was over particular geographic regions or during one of 199,964 time windows when DISCLA data were missing or contaminated. The classification as GRB or non-GRB of the 6236 events that were produced by the software trigger was aided by correlating the times and positions of the events against the Current BATSE Burst Catalog. There are 589 GRBs in the GUSBAD Catalog that are not included in the Current BATSE Burst Catalog. The GUSBAD catalog is uniform in the sense that the detection criterion is the same throughout and that the properties given in the catalog are available for every burst. The detection and the derivation of the properties listed in the catalog were carried out automatically, except for some rare instances. This makes the catalog especially suitable for statistical work and simulations, such as used in the evaluation of V/Vmax. The procedure used to detect and classify the bursts has been described in Schmidt (2004).</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=gusbad&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/gusbad.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The number counts show a relative dearth of X-ray sources in this region. A wealth of optical photometric and spectroscopic data are available in this field providing optical identifications and redshift determinations for the X-ray population. The optical photometry and spectroscopy used here are primarily from the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe 2 (DEEP2) survey with additional redshifts obtained from the literature. These are complemented with the deeper (r ~ 26 mag) multiwaveband data (ugriz) from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey to estimate photometric redshifts and to optically identify sources fainter than the DEEP2 magnitude limit (R&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;AB&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ 24.5 mag).

The availability of a large training set of spectroscopic redshifts that extends to faint magnitudes enabled photometric redshifts comparable to the highest quality results presently available for normal galaxies. The authors demonstrate that morphologically extended, faint X-ray sources without optical variability are more accurately described by a library of normal galaxies (corrected for emission lines) than by active galactic nucleus (AGN) dominated templates, even if these sources have AGNlike X-ray luminosities. Preselecting the library on the bases of the source properties allowed them to reach an accuracy sigma[Delta-z/(1+Z&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;spec&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;)] ~ 0.015 with a fraction of outliers of 5.8% for the entire Chandra-COSMOS sample. These Chandra sources are not contained in this table but are available in the HEASARC table CCOSMPHOTZ).

For 248 sources, their updated photometric redshift differs from the previous release by Delta-z &amp;amp;gt; 0.2. These changes are predominantly due to the inclusion of newly available deep H-band^ photometry (H&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;AB&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; = 24 mag). The authors illustrate once again the importance of a spectroscopic training sample and how an assumption about the nature of a source together, with the number and the depth of the available bands, influences the accuracy of the photometric redshifts determined for AGN. These considerations should be kept in mind when defining the observational strategies of upcoming large surveys targeting AGNs, such as eROSITA at X-ray energies and the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder Evolutionary Map of the Universe in the radio band.

They are characterized by strong magnetic activity. The ensuing high-energy emission is crucial for the evolution of their planets and the eventual presence of life on them. The authors systematically study the X-ray and ultraviolet emission of a subsample of M dwarfs from a recent proper-motion survey, selecting all M dwarfs within 10 pc to obtain a nearly volume-limited sample (~90% completeness). Archival ROSAT, XMM-Newton and GALEX data are combined with published spectroscopic studies of H-alpha emission and rotation to obtain a broad picture of stellar activity on M dwarfs. The authors make use of synthetic model spectra to determine the relative contributions of photospheric and chromospheric emission to the ultraviolet flux. They also analyze the same diagnostics for a comparison sample of young M dwarfs in the TW Hya association (~10 Myr old). The authors find that generally the emission in the GALEX bands is dominated by the chromosphere but the photospheric component is not negligible in early-M field dwarfs. The surface fluxes for the H-alpha, near-ultraviolet, far-ultraviolet and X-ray emission are connected via a power-law dependence. The authors present in the reference paper for the first time such flux-flux relations involving broad-band ultraviolet emission for M dwarfs. Activity indices are defined as the flux ratios between the activity diagnostics and the bolometric flux of the star in analogy to the Ca II R&apos;(HK) index. For a given spectral type, these indices display a spread of 2-3 dex which is largest for M4-type stars. Strikingly, at mid-M spectral types, the spread of rotation rates is also at its highest level. The mean activity index for fast rotators, likely representing the saturation level, decreases from X-rays over the FUV to the NUV band and H-alpha, i.e. the fractional radiation output increases with atmospheric height. The comparison to the ultraviolet and X-ray properties of TW Hya members shows a drop of nearly three orders of magnitude for the luminosity in these bands between ~10 Myr and a few Gyr age. A few young field dwarfs (&amp;amp;lt;1 Gyr) in the 10-pc sample bridge the gap indicating that the drop in magnetic activity with age is a continuous process. The slope of the age decay is steeper for the X-ray than for the UV luminosity. This sample is based on the All-Sky Catalog of bright M dwarfs published by Lepine &amp;amp;amp; Gaidos (2011, AJ, 142, 138, CDS Cat. J/AJ/142/138, available at the HEASARC as the MDWARFASC table).

Secondly, the sample has grown by 1 because of the reclassification of one of the X-ray sources (RX J1824.7+6509).

This table contains the optical identifications for the NEP catalog of X-ray sources, including basic X-ray data and properties of the sources. The classification of the optical counterparts to the NEP sources is very similar to that of previous surveys, in particular the Einstein Extended Medium Sensitivity Survey (EMSS).

By cross-correlation with the optical or near-infrared nuclei of these galaxies, 314 of them are identified to have an X-ray active galactic nucleus (AGN). The majority of them are low-luminosity AGNs and are unlikely X-ray binaries based upon their spatial distribution and luminosity functions. The AGN fraction is around 60% for elliptical galaxies and early-type spirals, but drops to roughly 20% for Sc and later types, consistent with previous findings in the optical. However, the X-ray survey is more powerful in finding weak AGNs, especially from regions with active star formation that may mask the optical AGN signature. For example, 31% of the H II nuclei are found to harbor an X-ray AGN. For most objects, a single power-law model subject to interstellar absorption is adequate to fit the spectrum, and the typical photon index is found to be around 1.8. For galaxies with a non-detection, their stacked Chandra image shows an X-ray excess with a luminosity of a few times 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;37&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg/s on average around the nuclear region, possibly composed of faint X-ray binaries. This paper reports on the technique and results of the survey; in-depth analysis and discussion of the results were to be reported in forthcoming papers, e.g., She et al. (2017, ApJ, 842, 131). The sample was assembled based on Chandra/ACIS observations that were publicly available as of 2016 March. The authors first generated a full list of ACIS observations, and then searched in the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) for galaxies within 50 Mpc whose nuclear positions were less than 8 arcminutes from the aim point of any Chandra observation. The adopted distances were taken from NED, in the following order of priority: surface brightness fluctuations, Cepheid variables, tip of the red giant branch, Type Ia supernovae, the fundamental plane, Faber-Jackson relation, Tully-Fisher relation. If more than one reference is available for the distance by the same means, the latest one is selected, unless otherwise specified. Whenever possible, the authors obtain positions of the galaxy nuclei based on measurements from near-infrared images, which suffer from less obscuration by dust or confusion from young star-forming regions. Most of the data come from the Two-Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) extended source catalog (Skrutskie et al. 2006, AJ, 131, 1163), or NED otherwise.

This study confirms the familiar pattern that the star formation rate (SFR) density, increases by at least a factor of ~ 5 from z = 0 to 1, although the authors note highly discrepant UV- and radio-based SFR estimates. Their radio-based SFRs become more difficult to interpret at z &amp;amp;gt; 1 where correcting for contamination by radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs) comes at the price of rejecting luminous starbursts. While stacking radio images is a useful technique, accurate radio-based SFRs for z &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; 1 galaxies require precise redshifts and extraordinarily high fidelity radio data to identify and remove accretion-related emission. Data were obtained at 1.4 GHz during 2003 to 2005 with the VLA in its B configuration, acquiring seven 3.125 MHz channels every 5 s at each of four intermediate frequencies. Data were obtained at six positions, spaced by 15 arcminutes, concentrating in the northern half of the EGS because of the proximity of 3C 295 (a 23 Jy source at 1.4 GHz). Around 18 hours of data were acquired for each of the field positions. Calibrated visibilities and associated weights were used to generate mosaics of 37 x 512&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; x 0.8 arcsec&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; pixel images to quilt the VLA&apos;s primary beam in each EGS field position. CLEAN boxes were placed tightly around all sources, and a series of IMAGR and CALIB tasks were run, clipping the UV data after subtracting CLEAN components generated by the third iteration of IMAGR. The central images from each of the pointings were then knitted together using FLATN, ignoring data beyond the primary beam&apos;s half-power point, to produce a large mosaic. The synthesized beam is circular, with a FWHM of ~ 3.8 arcseconds. To define a sample of radio sources, the authors searched signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) images using the SAD detection algorithm, emulating the technique described by Biggs &amp;amp;amp; Ivison (2006, MNRAS, 371, 963).

Target sources were selected from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) in fields observed by the Cosmic Background Imager (CBI); most are extragalactic active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with 1.4-GHz flux densities of 3-10 mJy. Using a maximum-likelihood analysis to obtain an unbiased estimate of the distribution of the 1.4 - 31 GHz spectral indices of these sources, the authors find a mean 31 - 1.4 GHz flux ratio of 0.110 +/- 0.003 corresponding to a spectral index alpha = -0.71+/-0.01 (S&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;nu&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ nu&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;alpha&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;); 9.0% +/- 0.8% of the sources have alpha &amp;amp;gt; -0.5 and 1.2% +/- 0.2% have alpha &amp;amp;gt; 0.

The second campaign (the results of which are given in the GBT31GHZ table) used the GBT from 2006 February to May. A companion paper (Sievers et al. 2009arXiv0901.4540S) presents the five-year CBI total intensity power spectrum incorporating the results of the point-source measurements discussed here. Reported error bars include a 10% and 5% rms gain uncertainty for GBT and OVRO measurements, respectively. Sources detected at greater than 4 sigma at 31 GHz are flagged (detection_flag = &apos;Y&apos;); for this calculation, the random gain uncertainty was excluded. In all 3165 sources were observed. The GBT catalog (the HEASARC GBT31GHZ table) contains 1490 sources. Of the 2315 useful OVRO observations many of the non-detections (and a few detections) were superceded by more sensitive GBT observations; the OVRO catalog contained in the present table therefore contains data on 1675 sources.

This table contains the X-ray catalog, fluxes, hardness ratios, and multi-wavelength fluxes. The log N versus log S agrees with those of previous surveys covering similar flux ranges. The Chandra and Spitzer flux limits are well matched: 771 (99%) of the X-ray sources have infrared (IR) or optical counterparts, and 333 have MIPS 24-micron detections. There are four optical-only X-ray sources and four with no visible optical/IR counterpart. The very deep (~2.7 microJansky rms) VLA data yield 251 (&amp;amp;gt; 4 sigma) radio counterparts, 44% of the X-ray sources in the field. The authors confirm that the tendency for lower X-ray flux sources to be harder is primarily due to absorption. As expected, there is no correlation between observed IR and X-ray fluxes. Optically bright, type 1, and red AGNs lie in distinct regions of the IR versus X-ray flux plots, demonstrating the wide range of spectral energy distributions in this sample and providing the potential for classification/source selection. Many optically bright sources, which lie outside the AGN region in the optical versus X-ray plots (f&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;r&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;/f&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;x&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt; 10), lie inside the region predicted for red AGNs in IR versus X-ray plots, consistent with the presence of an active nucleus. More than 40% of the X-ray sources in the VLA field are radio-loud using the classical definition of R&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;L&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;. The majority of these are red and relatively faint in the optical so that the use of R&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;L&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; to select those AGNs with the strongest radio emission becomes questionable. Using the 24-micron to radio flux ratio (q&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;24&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;) instead results in 13 of the 147 AGNs with sufficient data being classified as radio-loud, in good agreement with the ~10% expected for broad-lined AGNs based on optical surveys. The authors conclude that q&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;24&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; is a more reliable indicator of radio-loudness.

Harvard College 100, 1 - 6), provided spectral classification and rough positions for 272,150 stars and has been widely made use of by the astronomical community for over half a century. A second extension of the HD Catalog, the so-called Henry Draper Extension Charts (HDEC), subsequently extended this spectral classification to fainter magnitudes (Cannon 1937, Ann. Astron. Obs. Harvard College 105, 1; Cannon and Mayall 1949, Ann. Astron. Obs. Harvard College 112), thus adding nearly another 87,000 stars with derived spectral types. The information in the HDEC was published in the form of charts rather than tables like the HD and HDE Catalogs, and consequently has been barely utiized by modern astronomers. In the 1990&apos;s, after a pilot project of Roeser et al. (1991, Astr. Ap. Suppl., 88, 277) had demonstrated that it seemed feasible to `revive&apos; the HDEC data, they were converted into a catalog of accurate astrometric parameters along with magnitudes and spectral types by Nesterov et al. (1995, Astr. Ap. Suppl., 110, 367), who used measurements of Cartesian coordinates of stars in the charts and the positions in the Astrographic Catalog (AC) for subsequent cross-identification. The Nesterov et al. (1991) reference should be consulted for the full details on the procedures used to create this HDEC catalog. The HDEC catalog contains information on 86,933 stars, comprising accurate (0.5 arcseconds error) positions, (for more than 96 per cent of them) proper motions with a typical accuracy of 5.5 milliarcseconds (mas) per year, and the original spectral classifications. The current database contains the main portion of the catalog. An additional set of information, primarily comprising HD entries with cross-identifications with known or suspected variable stars, was included in the A.J. Cannon Memorial Volume (Cannon and Mayall 1949). This list was extended by Nesterov et al. (1991) to more than 500 identifications with variable stars.

A total of 784 radio components are identified, corresponding to 726 distinct radio sources, nearly all of which are identified with SWIRE sources in the companion table ATLASCSID. Of the radio sources with measured redshifts, most lie in the redshift range 0.5 to 2 and include both star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei. The authors identify a rare population of infrared-faint radio sources that are bright at radio wavelengths but are not seen in the available optical, infrared, or X-ray data. Such rare classes of sources can only be discovered in wide, deep surveys such as this. The radio observations where made on 2002 Apr 4-27, Aug 24-29 and 2004 Jan 7-12, Feb 1-5, Jun 6-12 and Nov 24-30, with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). The observations in 2002 were made in a mosaic of 7 overlapping fields, for a total of 149 hours of integration time, or 21.3 hours per pointing. The observations in 2004 were taken in the AT mosaic mode, in which the array was cycled around 21 pointing centers They total 173 hours of integration time, or 8.2 hours per pointing. All observations were made with two 128-MHz bands, centered on frequencies of 1344 and 1472 MHz. This table contains the list of 784 radio components given in Table 4 of the reference paper. The authors define a radio &apos;component&apos; as a region of radio emission identified in the source extraction process. They define a radio &apos;source&apos; as one or more radio components that appear to be physically connected and that probably correspond to one galaxy. Thus, the authors count a classical triple radio-loud source as being a radio source consisting of three radio components, but count a pair of interacting starburst galaxies as being two sources, each with one radio component.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=atlascscpt&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/atlascscpt.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

These are among the brightest X-ray sources in the sky, but their position uncertainties and the sparse multi-wavelength coverage until now have rendered the identification of their counterparts a demanding task with uncertain results. New all-sky multi-wavelength surveys of sufficient depth, like AllWISE and Gaia, and a new Bayesian statistics-based algorithm, NWAY, allow us, for the first time, to provide reliable counterpart associations. NWAY extends previous distance- and sky density-based association methods and, using one or more priors (e.g. colors, magnitudes), weights the probability that sources from two or more catalogs are simultaneously associated on the basis of their observable characteristics. Here, counterparts have been determined using a Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) color-magnitude prior. A reference sample of 4,524 XMM/Chandra and Swift X-ray sources demonstrates a reliability of 97.4 per cent for XMMSL2 sources. Combining the results of this work and of the matching of ROSAT All-Sky Survey 2RXS sources also reported in this study (the results of the latter are available as the HEASARC&apos;s database table NWAYAWGROS) with Chandra-COSMOS data, the authors propose a new separation between stars and AGN in the X-ray/WISE flux-magnitude plane, that is valid over six orders of magnitude. The authors also release the NWAY code and its user manual. NWAY was extensively tested with XMM-COSMOS data. Using two different sets of priors, the authors find an agreement of 96 per cent and 99 per cent with published Likelihood Ratio methods. Their results were achieved faster and without any follow-up visual inspection. With the advent of deep and wide area surveys in X-rays (e.g. SRG/eROSITA, Athena/WFI) and radio (ASKAP/EMU, LOFAR, APERTIF, etc.), NWAY will provide a powerful and reliable counterpart identification tool.

For these new clusters, the authors determined a homogeneous set of astrophysical parameters such as size, membership, motion, distance and age. In their previous work (the Browse table COCD based on the CDS Cat. J/A+A/438/1163), 520 already-known open clusters out of a sample of 1700 clusters from the literature were confirmed in the ASCC-2.5 using independent, objective methods. Using these same methods, the whole sky was systematically screened for new clusters. The newly detected clusters show the same distribution over the sky as the known ones. It is found that without the a priori knowledge about existing clusters the authors&apos; search lead to clusters which are, on average, brighter, have more members and cover larger angular radii than the 520 previously-known ones. On the basis of data on about 6,200 possible members (including about 2,200 most probable ones) and homogeneous methods of cluster parameter determination, the angular sizes of cluster cores and coronae, cluster heliocentric distances, colour-excesses, mean proper motions, and ages of 130 clusters and mean radial velocities of 69 clusters were established and collected in the COCD-1. Clusters in the catalogue are numbered in order of increasing J2000.0 Right Ascension. The 1st Extension of the Open Cluster Diagrams Atlas (OCDA-1) presents a set of open cluster diagrams used for the determination of parameters of the 130 newly discovered open clusters, and is intended to illustrate the quality of the constructed cluster membership, and the accuracy of the derived cluster parameters.

These observations, totaling ~193 ks after time filtering, were taken with the Advanced CCD Imaging Camera (ACIS) over a three-year period. Using a wavelet decomposition detection algorithm, the authors detected 318 individual point sources. For their analysis, they used a subset of 277 detections with &amp;amp;gt;= net 10 counts (a limiting luminosity of approximately 1.2 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;37&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; in the 0.5-2 keV band, outside the central 1.5 arcminutes bright galaxy core). This table contains this subset of 277 X-ray sources. The authors discuss the radial distribution of the point sources. Between 1.5 and 6 arcminutes from the center, 25% of the sources are likely to be background sources (active galactic nuclei (AGNs)) and 75% to be low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) within the galaxy, while at radial distances greater than 6 arcminutes, background sources (AGN) will dominate the point sources. The authors explore short and long-term variability (over timescales of 1 day to three years) for X-ray point sources in this elliptical galaxy. 54 sources (24%) in the common ACIS fields of view show significant variability between observations. Of these, 37 are detected with at least 10 net counts in only one observation and thus may be &amp;amp;quot;transient.&amp;amp;quot; In addition, ~10% of the sources in each observation show significant short-term variability. The cumulative luminosity function (LF) for the point sources in NGC 4636 can be represented as a power law of slope Alpha = 1.14 +/- 0.03. The authors do not detect, but estimate an upper limit of ~4.5 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;37&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; to the current X-ray luminosity of, the historical supernova SN1939A.

Since they expect 25% of these sources to be background AGN, the percentage matched with GCs could be as high as 50%. Of these matched sources, the authors find that ~70% are associated with the redder GC candidates, those that are thought to have near-solar metal abundance. The fraction of GC candidates with an X-ray point source match decreases with decreasing GC luminosity. The authors do not find a correlation between the X-ray luminosities of the matched point sources and the luminosity or color of the host GC candidates.

The final aim of this research is to provide a comprehensive view of this complex region, which includes several distinct associations and dark clouds. The authors aim to uncover the population of the central, young star cluster Collinder 69, and in particular to find those diskless Class III pre-main sequence objects which have not been identified by previous surveys based on near- and mid-infrared searches, and to establish the X-ray luminosity function for the association. The authors have combined two exposures taken with the XMM-Newton satellite with an exhaustive data set of optical, near- and mid-infrared photometry to assess the membership of the X-ray sources based on different color-color and color-magnitude diagrams, as well as other properties, such as effective temperatures, masses and bolometric luminosities derived from spectral energy distribution fitting and comparison with theoretical isochrones. The presence of circumstellar disks is discussed using mid-infrared photometry from the Spitzer Space Telescope. The authors searched for optical and IR counterparts for their X-ray detections, using a radius of 5.1 arcseconds. This search radius is motivated by the astrometry of XMM-Newton (~ 1-2 arcsec) and the statistical errors of the X-ray sources (&amp;amp;lt;= 4 arcsecs). Multiple counterparts were found for several X-ray sources within their search radius. The visual inspection of all optical and IR images indicated that in a few cases there were additional possible counterparts even slightly beyond this search radius. In order to be as comprehensive as possible, the authors have also retained them. They compiled a master catalog with all sources that were present in at least one of the mappings (optical, near-IR or mid-IR) and extracted the photometry from these surveys. The photometry of all possible counterparts to X-ray sources is listed in this table. The reference sources for the optical and infrared magnitudes are discussed in Section 3 of the reference paper.

Of the 4,805 sources with GALEX counterparts, 797 have NUV emission significantly (&amp;amp;gt; 2.5 sigma) in excess of an empirical basal level. The authors inspected these candidate active stars using visible-wavelength spectra, high-resolution adaptive optics imaging, time-series photometry, and literature searches to identify cases where the elevated NUV emission is due to unresolved background sources or stellar companions; they estimated the overall occurrence of these &amp;amp;quot;false positives&amp;amp;quot; (FPs) as ~ 16%. The authors constructed an NUV luminosity function that accounted for FPs, detection biases of the source catalogs, and GALEX upper limits.

From the low (mu &amp;amp;gt; 40 mas yr&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;) proper motion limit and high level of completeness of the SUPERBLINK catalog in that magnitude range, the authors estimate that their spectroscopic census most likely includes &amp;amp;gt; 90% of all existing, northern-sky M dwarfs with apparent magnitude J &amp;amp;lt; 9&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;m&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;. Only 682 stars in this sample are listed in the Third Catalog of Nearby Stars (CNS3, Gliese and Jahreiss 1991); most others are relative unknowns and have spectroscopic data presented here for the first time. Spectral subtypes are assigned based on spectral index measurements of CaH and TiO molecular bands; a comparison of spectra from the same stars obtained at different observatories, however, reveals that spectral band index measurements are dependent on spectral resolution, spectrophotometric calibration, and other instrumental factors. As a result, the authors find that a consistent classification scheme requires that spectral indices be calibrated and corrected for each observatory/instrument used. After systematic corrections and a recalibration of the subtype-index relationships for the CaH2, CaH3, TiO5, and TiO6 spectral indices, the authors find that they can consistently and reliably classify all the stars to a half-subtype precision. The use of corrected spectral indices further requires them to recalibrate the zeta parameter, a metallicity indicator based on the ratio of TiO and CaH optical bandheads. However, the authors find that their zeta values are not sensitive enough to diagnose metallicity variations in dwarfs of subtypes M2 and earlier (+/- 0.5 dex accuracy) and are only marginally useful at later M3-M5 subtypes (+/- 0.2 dex accuracy). Fits of their spectra to the Phoenix atmospheric model grid are used to estimate effective temperatures. These suggest the existence of a plateau in the M1-M3 subtype range, in agreement with model fits of infrared spectra but at odds with photometric determinations of T&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;eff&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;. Existing geometric parallax measurements are extracted from the literature for 624 stars, and are used to determine spectroscopic and photometric distances for all the other stars. Active dwarfs are identified from measurements of H-alpha equivalent widths, and the authors find a strong correlation between H-alpha emission in M dwarfs and detected X-ray emission from ROSAT and/or a large UV excess in the GALEX point source catalog. Proper motion data and photometric distances are combined in order to evaluate the (U, V, W) distribution in velocity space, which is found to correlate tightly with the velocity distribution of G dwarfs in the solar neighborhood. However, active stars show a smaller dispersion in their space velocities, which is consistent with those stars being younger on average. The authors state that this catalog will be very useful for guiding the selection of the best M dwarf targets for exoplanet searches, in particular those using high-precision radial velocity measurements.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=bnmdspecat&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/bnmdspecat.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

This sample is an extension of the first AGILE catalog of gamma-ray sources (1AGL), obtained using the complete set of AGILE observations in pointing mode performed during a 2.3 year period from July 9, 2007 until October 30, 2009. The dataset of AGILE pointed observations covers a long time interval and its gamma-ray data archive is useful for monitoring studies of medium-to-high brightness gamma-ray sources. In the analysis reported here, the authors used data obtained with an improved event filter that covers a wider field of view, on a much larger (about 27.5 months) dataset, integrating data on observation block (OB) time scales, which mostly range from a few days to thirty days. The data processing resulted in a better characterized source list than 1AGL was, and includes 54 sources, 7 of which are new high galactic latitude (|b_II_|&amp;amp;gt;= 5 degrees) sources, 8 are new sources on the galactic plane, and 20 sources are from the previous catalogue with revised positions. Eight 1AGL sources (2 high-latitude and 6 on the galactic plane) were not detected in the final processing either because of low OB exposure and/or due to their position in complex galactic regions. The reference paper reports the results in a catalog of all the detections obtained in each single OB, including the variability results for each of these sources. In particular, the authors found that 12 sources out of 42 or 11 out of 53 are variable, depending on the variability index used, where 42 and 53 are the number of sources for which these indices could be calculated. Seven of the 11 variable sources are blazars, the others are the Crab pulsar+nebula, LS I +61 303, Cyg X-3, and 1AGLR J2021+4030. This HEASARC table contains 54 AGILE-detected sources and the main parameters of their maximum significance (defined by sqrt(TS)) detections: for each source, the name, coordinates, the sqrt(TS) value as a measure of the detection significance, the E &amp;amp;gt; 100 MeV flux, the four variability indices described in Section 5 of the reference paper, the number of detections, the confirmed counterparts and source class, if any, and other possible associations ordered according to the angular distance from the AGL source are given.

       "<tr><td>610</td><td>optical#radio#x-ray</td><td>AGNSDSSXM2</td><td>ivo://nasa.heasarc/agnsdssxm2</td><td>X-ray emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is dominated by the accretion disk around a supermassive black hole. The radio luminosity, however, has not such a clear origin except in the most powerful sources where jets are evident. The origin (and even the very existence) of the local bi-modal distribution in radio-loudness is also a debated issue. By analyzing X-ray, optical and radio properties of a large sample of type 1 AGN and quasars (QSOs) up to z &amp;amp;gt; 2, where the bulk of this population resides, the authors aim to explore the interplay between radio and X-ray emission in AGN, in order to further our knowledge on the origin of radio emission, and its relation to accretion. They analyze a large (~800 sources) sample of type 1 AGN and QSOs selected from the 2XMMi XMM-Newton X-ray source catalog, cross-correlated with the SDSS DR7 spectroscopic catalog, covering a redshift range from z ~ 0.3 to z ~ 2.3. Supermassive black hole masses are estimated from the Mg II emission line, bolometric luminosities from the X-ray data, and radio emission or upper limits from the FIRST catalog. Most of the sources accrete close to the Eddington limit and the distribution in radio-loudness does not appear to have a bi-modal behavior. This study confirms that radio-loud AGN are also X-ray loud, with an X-ray-to-optical ratio up to twice that of radio-quiet objects, even excluding the most extreme strongly jetted sources. By analyzing complementary radio-selected control samples, the authors find evidence that these conclusions are not an effect of the X-ray selection, but are likely a property of the dominant QSO population. The authors of this catalog conclude that their findings are best interpreted in a context where radio emission in AGN, with the exception of a minority of beamed sources, arises from very close to the accretion disk and is therefore heavily linked to X-ray emission. They also speculate that the radio-loud/radio-quiet dichotomy might either be an evolutionary effect that developed well after the QSO peak epoch, or an effect of incompleteness in small samples. Basic information and derived properties are presented for the sample of X-ray selected type 1 AGN (as well as for the 11 X-ray undetected type 1 AGN in the &amp;amp;quot;control sample&amp;amp;quot;): coordinates, redshift, X-ray and radio fluxes, optical magnitudes, from the SDSS, 2XMMi, and FIRST catalogs; continuum luminosities at 3000 Angstroms and in the X-ray band, black hole masses, bolometric luminosities, Eddington ratios; for the sources falling in the FIRST field, optical fluxes at 2500 and 4400 Angstroms, X-ray-to-optical index, radio classification, and the ratios between the radio and the UV, optical, and X-ray fluxes.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=agnsdssxm2&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/agnsdssxm2.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

EGRET is sensitive to photons in the energy range from about 30 MeV to over 20 GeV, the highest energies accessible by the CGRO instruments, and, like COMPTEL, is an imaging instrument. In addition to including more data than the Second EGRET Catalog (2EG, Thompson et al. 1995, ApJS, 101, 259) and its supplement (2EGS, Thompson et al. 1996, ApJS, 107, 227), this catalog uses completely reprocessed data so as to correct a number of mostly minimal errors and problems. The 271 sources (E &amp;amp;gt; 100 MeV) in the catalog include the single 1991 solar flare that was bright enough to detected as a source, the LMC, 5 pulsars, one probable radio galaxy detection (Cen A), and 66 high-confidence identifications of blazars (BL Lac objects, flat-spectrum radio quasars, or unidentified flat-spectrum radio sources). In addition, 27 lower-confidence potential blazar identifications are noted. Finally, the catalog contains 170 sources that are not yet firmly identified with known objects, although potential identifications have been suggested for a number of these. As already noted, there are 271 distinct sources in this catalog: since there are multiple measurements for these sources corresponding to the various viewing periods, there are 5246 entries in the HEASARC&apos;s version of the 3rd EGRET Catalog corresponding to the same number of lines in Table 4 of the published version.

The source-finding tool described by Tennant (2006, AJ, 132, 1372) was applied to all 4 individual data sets and to the merged data set in order to search for discrete X-ray sources. The search was limited to the cnetral 6&apos; x 6&apos; (6 kpc x 6 kpc) region and to events within the full Chandra energy range 0.3-8.0 keV. Fifty eight point sources were detected in the merged data set with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) above 2.8 and with a minimum of 5 sigma above background uncertainty (corresponding to a detection limit of 8-10 counts for a typical on-axis source). These sources were listed in Table 2 of the reference paper and and are contained in the present HEASARC table. They can be selected by specifying source_type = &apos;Point Source&apos;. The X-ray data were also examined to see if there was emission from known SNRs and H II regions after masking out the afore-mentioned X-ray point sources (see Section 2.1 of the reference paper for full details). Events falling within the areas defined by 24 optically identified SNRs that were imaged on the S3 chip in the first three observations were used to construct a composite spectrum.

Out of 284 X-ray sources detected, 155 are identified with photometric cluster members, with very little ambiguity, another 60 with non-members. There are 4 X-ray sources with two possible optical identifications (one cluster member and one nonmember for each), with no obvious choice between the two candidates. These 4 X-ray sources are listed in this Browse table twice, one for each optical counterpart, hence there are (284 + 4 =) 288 entries. There remain 73 X-ray sources without an optical identification with the authors&apos; optical catalog stars.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=ngc2516cxo&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/ngc2516cxo.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

This sample of 304 afterglows consists of 2,995 flux density measurements (including upper limits) at frequencies between 0.6 GHz and 660 GHz, with the majority of data taken in the 8.5-GHz frequency band (1,539 measurements). The authors use this dataset to carry out a statistical analysis of the radio-selected sample. The detection rate of radio afterglows stayed unchanged almost at 31% before and after the launch of the Swift satellite. The canonical long-duration GRB radio light curve at 8.5 GHz peaks at three to six days in the source rest frame, with a median peak luminosity of 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;31&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg/s/Hz. The peak radio luminosities for short-hard bursts, X-ray flashes, and the supernova-GRB classes are an order of magnitude or more fainter than this value. There are clear relationships between the detectability of a radio afterglow and the fluence or energy of a GRB, and the X-ray or optical brightness of the afterglow. However, the authors find few significant correlations between these same GRB and afterglow properties and the peak radio flux density. In their paper, they also produce synthetic light curves at centimeter and millimeter bands using a range of blast wave and microphysics parameters derived from multi-wavelength afterglow modeling, and use them to compare with the radio sample. Finding agreement, the authors extrapolate this behavior to predict the centimeter and millimeter behavior of GRBs which will observed by the Expanded Very Large Array and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. The compiled sample consists of 304 GRBs observed with radio telescopes between 1997 January and 2011 January, along with the 2011 April 28 Fermi burst, GRB 110428A. The sample consists of a total of 2,995 flux density measurements taken in the frequency range from 0.6 to 660 GHz and spanning a time range from 0.026 to 1,339 days. Most of the afterglows (270 in total) in this sample were observed as part of VLA radio afterglow programs, whereas 15 bursts were observed by the Expanded VLA (EVLA), and 19 southern bursts with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). This catalog describes the radio, optical and X-ray afterglow detections (see Section 2.2 of the reference paper): out of the 304 bursts, 123 bursts were observed in the pre-Swift epoch from 1997 until 2004. The remaining 181 bursts were observed between 2005 and 2011 April (the post-Swift epoch). Out of the 95 radio-detected afterglows (see Section 2.2 of the reference paper), 63 had radio lightcurves (i.e., three or more detections in a single radio band), whereas 32 bursts had less than three detections. For the GRBs for which the light curves were available, the authors determined the peak flux density and the time of the peak in the VLA frequency bands (i.e., 1.4 GHz, 4.9 GHz, 8.5 GHz, 15 GHz, and 22.5 GHz bands) by fitting the data with forward shock formula of the form (Frail 2005, IAU Coll. 192, p. 451) given in equation (1) of the reference paper. This formula may not accurately represent the full complexity of the radio lightcurve evolution. However, it is good enough to determine the approximate values for the peak flux density F&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;m&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; and the time of the peak t&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;m&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;. See the discussion in Section 3.5 of the reference paper for more details and some caveats. For the remaining bursts, the flux density values were taken directly from the data, and hence do not have the best-fit errors for the peak flux, peak time and rest-frame peak time parameters F&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;m&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;, t&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;m&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; and t&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;m&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;/(1+z), respectively.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=rssgrbag&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/rssgrbag.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

In this Updated Zwicky Catalog (UZC), some of the inadequacies of previous catalogs are corrected by providing (1) coordinates with ~&amp;amp;lt;2 arcsecond errors for all of the 19,369 catalog galaxies, (2) homogeneously estimated redshifts cz (radial velocities) for the majority (98%) of the data taken at the CfA (14,632 spectra), and (3) an estimate of the remaining &amp;amp;quot;blunder&amp;amp;quot; rate for both the CfA redshifts and for those compiled from the literature. For the reanalyzed CfA data a calibrated, uniformly determined error and an indication of the presence of emission lines in each spectrum are included. Redshifts (radial velocities) are provided for the 7257 galaxies in the CfA2 redshift survey that were not previously published; for another 5625 CfA redshifts (radial velocities), the remeasured or uniformly rereduced values are listed. Among the new measurements, 1807 are members of UZC &amp;amp;quot;multiplets&amp;amp;quot; associated with the original Zwicky catalog position in the coordinate range where the catalog is 98% complete.

It was placed in a nearly circular orbit at a geocentric distance of ~118,000 km on 23 May 1969; the orbital period was ~112 hours. The satellite rotated about its spin axis with a ~64-sec period. The X-ray detector was located ~90 degrees from the spin axis, and so covered the celestial sphere twice per satellite orbit. Data were telemetered in 1-sec count accumulations. Vela 5B operated until 19 June 1979, although telemetry tracking was poor after mid-1976. The scintillation X-ray detector (XC) aboard Vela 5B consisted of two 1-mm-thick NaI(Tl) crystals mounted on photomultiplier tubes and covered by a 5-mil-thick beryllium window. Electronic thresholds provided two energy channels, 3-12 keV and 6-12 keV. In front of each crystal was a slat collimator providing a FWHM aperture of ~6.1x6.1 degrees.

We require that the event is a gamma-ray (FswGamState==0). * TkrNumTracks is the number of tracks in the tracker. We require that there is at least one track. This requires the event to have a reconstructed direction. * GltEngine is the status of the &amp;amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://oraweb.slac.stanford.edu/pls/slacquery/DOCUMENTS.DetailedIndex?PROJECT=GLAST&amp;amp;P_DOC_ID=776972&quot;&amp;amp;gt;Global LAT Trigger&amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;gt;.

If the GBM catalog position of the burst is updated (due to a refined localization from LAT or Swift or from subsequent on ground analysis), the LLE data are automatically updated and new versions of the LLE files are produced. In some cases, LLE data are manually generated (using a better localization which may or may not have been used in the GBM Trigger Catalog). For each updated position, the version of the corresponding LLE files increases by one. There are six FITS files provided for each entry: the LLE event file, the time-binned spectrum (CSPEC) file, the CSPEC response (RSP) file, and the extracted burst spectrum (the PHA-I file) for the entire duration of the burst, an LLE event file with same time cut as the RSP and PHA-I files, and a LAT pointing and livetime history file. There are six FITS files provided for each entry: the LLE event file (gll_lle_bnNNNNNNNNN_vMM.fit), the time-binned spectrum (CSPEC) file (gll_cspec_bnNNNNNNNNN_vMM.pha), the CSPEC response (RSP) file (gll_cspec _bnNNNNNNNNN_vMM.rsp), and the extracted burst spectrum (the PHA-I file) for the entire duration of the burst (gll_pha_bnNNNNNNNNN_vMM.fit), an LLE event file with same time cut as the RSP and PHA-I files (gll_selected_bnNNNNNNNNN_vMM.fit), and a LAT pointing and livetime history file (gll_pt_bnNNNNNNNNN_vMM.fit). The LLE event file format is similar to the LAT photon file format with some exceptions. Because the LLE data are tightly connected to a particular object (position and time), the FITS keyword OBJECT has been added to the file. Generally, OBJECT will correspond to the entry of the GBM Trigger Catalog used to generate LLE data and corresponds to the &amp;amp;quot;name&amp;amp;quot; column in the FERMILLE table (and in the GBM Trigger Catalog table). For similar reasons, the position of the object used to select LLE file is written in the header of each extension of each LLE file. PROC_VER corresponds to the iteration of the analysis of LLE data. PASS_VER corresponds to the iteration for the reconstruction and the general event classification (Pass6, Pass7, etc.). VERSION corresponds to the version of the LLE product for this particular event. The update of a location of a GRB will increase the number of VERSION in the file, but will leave the PASS_VER and PROC_VER unchanged. The CSPEC file is obtained from directly binning the TTE files. It provides a series of spectra, accumulated every second, from -1000 to 1000 seconds around the burst. Each spectrum is binned in 50 energy channels, ranging typically from 10 MeV to 100 GeV. The format of the CSPEC file is tailored to satisfy rmfit standards, and it is not directly usable in XSPEC. The CSPEC Response file (the RSP file) is the detector response matrix calculated from Monte Carlo simulation, and it corresponds to a single response matrix for each Gamma-Ray Burst or Solar Flare. The PHA-I file contains the count spectrum. The PHA-I file is created from the same time interval used to compute the response matrix. The selected events file is identical to the LLE event file with an additional time selection applied to match the cut used to compute response matrix and PHA-I files. The LAT pointing and livetime history file is identical to the standard LAT file but with entries every second (instead of every 30 seconds). It spans 4600 seconds before and 4600 after the trigger time.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=fermille&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/fermille.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The authors ran WAVDETECT from the CIAO 2.2 software package using wavelet scales from 1 to 16 pixels spaced by factors of 2, setting a false-source probability detection threshold of 10^-6, which should yield an expectation value of slightly less than one false source over the entire ACIS-S chip. They identify 144 X-ray point sources outside the nuclear region, 72 of which are located within the HST fields. An additional 3 sources are within 8&amp;amp;quot; of the center of the galaxy and appear to be associated either with a weak active galactic nucleus or with brightness enhancements in the hot interstellar gas. One additional source (not included in this table) appears to be a spurious detection, as WAVDETECT assigns it a count rate of 1.5 counts, and visual inspection fails to find evidence of a source at that location. The optical data show 1102 sources whose half-light radii are small enough to be globular cluster candidates, 829 of which also have colors consistent with being globular clusters (with only four in the restricted central 10&amp;amp;quot; region). 30 X-ray sources within 0.7&amp;amp;quot; of an optical source with optical colors consistent with being globular clusters were found. Two additional sources show optical colors outside the globular cluster color range and are likely to be either foreground or background objects. The thirty globular cluster matches are likely to be low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) associated with the globular clusters, while ~ 42 of the X-ray sources have no optical counterparts to V &amp;amp;lt;~ 25 and I &amp;amp;lt;~ 24, indicating that they are likely to be predominantly LMXBs in the field star population with a small amount of possible contamination from background active galactic nuclei. Thus approximately 40% of the X-ray sources are in globular clusters and ~ 4% of the globular clusters contain X-ray sources.

Previous infrared observations have shown that this remarkable cluster contains several hundred embedded young stars, most of which are still surrounded by circumstellar disks. Thus, it presents a rare opportunity to study X-ray activity in a large sample of optically invisible protostars and classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs) undergoing accretion. Chandra detected 283 X-ray sources, of which 248 were identified with counterparts at other wavelengths, mostly in the near-infrared. Astrometric registration of Chandra images against the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) resulted in positional offsets of ~0.25&amp;amp;quot; near field center, yielding high confidence identifications of infrared counterparts. The Chandra detections are characterized by hard, heavily absorbed spectra and specular variability. Spectral analysis of more than 100 of the brightest X-ray sources yields a mean V-band extinction of ~10.5 magnitudes and typical plasma energies &amp;amp;lt;kT&amp;amp;gt; ~ 3 keV. Chandra detected all but one of a sample of 27 classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs) identified from previous near- and mid-infrared photometry, and their X-ray and bolometric luminosities are correlated.

The main BCS, which was presented in Ebeling et al. (1998, MNRAS, 301, 881; Paper I), is a 90% flux-complete sample of the 201 X-ray-brightest clusters of galaxies in the northern hemisphere (Dec &amp;amp;gt;=0 degrees), at high Galactic latitudes (|b| &amp;amp;gt;= 20 degrees), with measured redshifts z &amp;amp;lt;= 0.3 and X-ray fluxes higher than 4.4 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-12&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg/cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;/s in the 0.1 - 2.4 keV band. This sample, called the ROSAT Brightest Cluster Sample, is selected from RASS data and is the largest X-ray-selected cluster sample compiled to the publication date (1998). In addition to Abell clusters which form the bulk of the sample, the BCS also contains the X-ray-brightest Zwicky clusters and other clusters selected from their X-ray properties alone. Effort has been made to ensure the highest possible completeness of the sample and the smallest possible contamination by non-cluster X-ray sources. X-ray fluxes were computed using an algorithm tailored for the detection and characterization of X-ray emission from galaxy clusters. These fluxes are accurate to better than 15% (mean 1-sigma error). The low-flux extension of the X-ray-selected ROSAT Brightest Cluster Sample was published in Ebeling et al. (2000, MNRAS, 318, 333; Paper IV). Like the original BCS and employing an identical selection procedure, the BCS extension is compiled from ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS) data in the northern hemisphere (Dec &amp;amp;gt;=0 degrees) and at high Galactic latitudes (|b| &amp;amp;gt;= 20 degrees). It comprises 99 X-ray-selected clusters of galaxies with measured redshifts z &amp;amp;lt;= 0.3 (as well as eight more at z &amp;amp;gt; 0.3) and total fluxes between 2.8 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-12&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; and 4.4 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-12&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg/cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;/s in the 0.1 - 2.4keV band (the latter value being the flux limit of the original BCS). The extension can be combined (as it has been in this HEASARC table) with the main sample published in 1998 to form the homogeneously selected extended BCS (eBCS), the largest and statistically best understood cluster sample to emerge from the RASS to date. The nominal completeness of the combined sample (defined with respect to a power-law fit to the bright end of the BCS log N -log S distribution) is relatively low at 75% (compared with 90% for the high-flux sample of Paper I). However, just as for the original BCS, this incompleteness can be accurately quantified, and thus statistically corrected for, as a function of X-ray luminosity and redshift. In addition to its importance for improved statistical studies of the properties of clusters in the local Universe, the low-flux extension of the BCS is also intended to serve as a finding list for X-ray-bright clusters in the northern hemisphere which the authors hoped will prove useful in the preparation of cluster observations to be made with the next generation of X-ray telescopes such as Chandra and XMM-Newton.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=rassebcs&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/rassebcs.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The authors performed a deep Chandra X-ray observation of the S254-S258 region in order to efficiently discriminate young stars (with and without circumstellar matter) from the numerous older field stars in the area. They detected 364 X-ray point sources in a 17&apos; x 17&apos; (~ 8 x 8 pc) field. This X-ray catalog provides, for the first time, a complete sample of all young stars in the region down to about 0.5 M_{sun}_. A clustering analysis identifies three significant clusters: the central embedded cluster S255-IR and two smaller clusterings in S256 and S258. Sixty-four X-ray sources can be classified as members in one of these clusters. After accounting for X-ray background contaminants, this implies that about 250 X-ray sources constitute a widely scattered population of young stars, distributed over the full field-of-view of the X-ray image. This distributed young stellar population is considerably larger than the previously known number of non-clustered young stars selected by infrared excesses. Comparison of the X-ray luminosity function with that of the Orion Nebula Cluster suggests a total population of ~ 2000 young stars in the observed part of the S254-S258 region. The S254-S258 complex was observed (PI: Preibisch) in November 2009 with the Imaging Array of the Chandra Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS-I). ACIS-I provides a field of view of 17&apos; x 17&apos; on the sky. At the 1.6 kpc distance of S254-S258 this corresponds to 7.9 x 7.9 pc. The aimpoint of the observation was RA(J2000) = 06h12m54.0s, Dec(J2000) = +17d 59&apos; 24&amp;amp;quot;. The observation was performed in the standard &apos;Timed Event, Faint&apos; mode (with 3 x 3 pixel event islands). The total net exposure time of 74725 s (20.76 h) was split into two parts, separated by about 4 days. The details of these two observation parts are given in Table 1 of the reference paper. The authors first employed the wavdetect algorithm (Freeman et al. 2002, ApJS, 138, 185, a CIAO mexican-hat wavelet source detection tool) for locating X-ray sources in the merged image, and used a rather low detection threshold of 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-5&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;. This step was performed in three different energy bands, the total band (0.5 - 8.0 keV), the soft band (0.5 - 2.0 keV), and the hard band (2.0 - 8.0) keV, and with wavelet scales between 1 and 16 pixels. They also performed a visual inspection of the images and added some 30 additional candidates to the merged catalog from the wavelet analysis, resulting in a final catalog of 511 potential X-ray sources. To clean this catalog from spurious sources, they then performed a detailed analysis of each individual candidate source with the ACIS Extract (AE hereafter) software package (Broos et al. 2010, ApJ, 714, 1582). The Poisson probability (P&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;B&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;) associated with the &amp;amp;quot;null hypothesis&amp;amp;quot;, i.e. that no source exists and the extracted events are solely due to Poisson fluctuations in the local background, was computed for each source using AE. All candidate sources with P&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;B&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt; 0.01 were rejected as background fluctuations. After 8 iterations of this pruning procedure the final catalog consisted of 364 sources. It contains 344 primary sources with P&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;B&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt; 0.003, and 20 tentative sources with 0.003 &amp;amp;lt; P&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;B&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt; 0.01. To obtain an estimate of the intrinsic, i.e. extinction-corrected, X-ray luminosity for sources that are too weak for a detailed spectral analysis, the authors used the XPHOT software, developed by Getman et al. (2010, ApJ, 708, 1760). XPHOT is based on a non-parametric method for the calculation of fluxes and absorbing X-ray column densities of weak X-ray sources. X-ray extinction and intrinsic flux are estimated from the comparison of the apparent median energy of the source photons and apparent source flux with those of high signal-to-noise spectra that were simulated using spectral models characteristic of much brighter sources of similar class previously studied in detail. This method requires at least 4 net counts per source (in order to determine a meaningful value for the median energy) and can thus be applied to 255 of the 364 sources in this table. To calculate luminosities, a distance of 1.6 kpc was assumed. The resulting intrinsic X-ray lumonosities range from 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;29.4&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; to 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;32.3&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=s254258cxo&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/s254258cxo.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

In ChIcAGO, the sub-arcsecond localization capabilities of Chandra have been combined with a detailed multi-wavelength follow-up program, with the ultimate goal of classifying the &amp;amp;gt; 100 unidentified sources in the AGPS. Overall to date, 93 unidentified AGPS sources have been observed with Chandra as part of the ChIcAGO survey. A total of 253 X-ray point sources have been detected in these Chandra observations within 3 arcminutes of the original ASCA positions. The authors have identified infrared and optical counterparts to the majority of these sources, using both new observations and catalogs from existing Galactic plane surveys. X-ray and infrared population statistics for the X-ray point sources detected in the Chandra observations reveal that the primary populations of Galactic plane X-ray sources that emit in the X-ray flux range from ~ 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-13&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; to 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-11&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; are active stellar coronae, massive stars with strong stellar winds that are possibly in colliding wind binaries, X-ray binaries, and magnetars. There is also another primary population that is still unidentified but, on the basis of its X-ray and infrared properties, likely comprises partly Galactic sources and partly active galactic nuclei. A total of 93 AGPS sources have been observed with Chandra as part of the ChIcAGO survey, of which 84 were imaged with ACIS-S and 9 were imaged with HRC-I. The ChIcAGO Chandra observations took place over a 3.5 yr period, from 2007 January to 2010 July. The Chandra exposure times ranged from ~ 1 to 10 ks. All the details of these Chandra observations are listed in Table 1 of the reference paper. The initial automated analysis of these Chandra observations was conducted using the ChIcAGO Multi-wavelength Analysis Pipeline (MAP), described in Section 2.2 of the reference paper. ChIcAGO MAP takes the ACIS-S or HRC-I Chandra observation of an AGPS source field and detects and analyzes all point sources within 3 arcminutes, equivalent to the largest likely position error, for the original AGPS source positions supplied by Sugizaki et al. (2001, ApJS, 134, 77). The authors then performed a more detailed X-ray analysis and counterpart study for those 74 sources with &amp;amp;gt; 20 X-ray counts, as such sources are approximately within the original AGPS sources X-ray flux range (see Sections 3.2 and 3.3 of the reference paper). Infrared and optical follow-up were primarily performed on those ChIcAGO sources having &amp;amp;gt; 20 X-ray counts. In order to determine which optical and infrared sources are counterparts to ChIcAGO sources, the authors used a technique similar to that described by Zhao et al. (2005, ApJS, 161, 429), using their Equation (11). If the separation between a ChIcAGO source&apos;s wavdetect position and its possible counterpart is less than the quadratic sum of their 3-sigma positional errors and the 3-sigma Chandra pointing error, then the X-ray and optical (or infrared) sources are likely to be associated. The 1-sigma positional errors for all sources in the 2MASS PSC and GLIMPSE catalogs are 0.1 arcseconds and 0.3 arcseconds, respectively. USNO B has an astrometric accuracy of &amp;amp;lt; 0.25 arcseconds. The authors have assumed that the error distributions of the Chandra observations, Chandra pointing, and USNO B Catalog are all Gaussian for the purposes of identifying possible counterparts to the ChIcAGO sources.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=chicagocxo&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/chicagocxo.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) at wavelengths of 4 and 6 cm (frequencies of 7.5 and 4.5 GHz). In total, 189 sources were detected, 56 of them associated with known young stellar objects (YSOs), and 4 with known extragalactic objects; the other 129 remain unclassified, but most of them are most probably background quasars. The vast majority of the young stars detected at radio wavelengths have spectral types K or M, although four objects of A/F/B types and two brown dwarf candidates are also detected. At least half of these young stars are non-thermal (gyrosynchrotron) sources, with active coronae characterized by high levels of variability, negative spectral indices, and (in some cases) significant circular polarization. As expected, there is a clear tendency for the fraction of non-thermal sources to increase from the younger (Class 0/I or flat spectrum) to the more evolved (Class III or weak-line T Tauri) stars. The young stars detected both in X-rays and at radio wavelengths broadly follow a Gudel-Benz relation, but with a different normalization than the most radio-active types of stars. Finally, the authors detected a ~70 mJy compact extragalactic source near the center of the Ophiuchus core, which should be used as gain calibrator for any future radio observations of this region. The observations were obtained with the JVLA of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO). Two frequency sub-bands, each 1-GHz wide, and centered at 4.5 and 7.5 GHz, respectively, were recorded simultaneously. The observations were obtained on three different epochs (2011 February 17/19, April 3/4, and May 4/6) typically separated from one another by a month. The angular resolution of the observations is of the order of 1 arcsecond. To identify sources in their observations, the authors used the images corresponding to the concatenation of the three epochs, which provided the highest sensitivity. The criteria used to consider a detection as firm were: (1) sources with reported counterparts and a flux larger than four times the rms noise of the area, or (2) sources with a flux larger than five times the rms noise of the area and without reported counterparts. The authors searched the literature for previous radio detections, and for counterparts at X-ray, optical, near-infrared, and mid-infrared wavelengths. The search was done in SIMBAD, and accessed all the major catalogs (listed explicitly in the footnote of Table 3 in the reference paper). Note that the Spitzer c2d catalog includes cross-references to other major catalogs which were taken into account in their counterpart search. The authors considered a radio source associated with a counterpart at another wavelengths if the separation between the two was below the combined uncertainties of the two data sets. This was about 1.5 arcseconds for the optical and infrared catalogs, but could be significantly larger for some of the radio catalogs (for instance, the NVSS has a positional uncertainty of about 5 arcseconds). The authors found that only 76 of the sources detected here had previously been reported at radio wavelengths (matches are listed in the radio_name parameter in such cases), while the other 113 are new radio detections. On the other hand, they found a total of 100 counterparts at other wavelengths. Note that there are a significant number of sources that were previously known at radio wavelengths and have known counterparts at other frequencies. As a consequence, the number of sources that were previously known (at any frequency) is 134, while 55 of the sources in this sample are reported here for the first time. The authors argue that most of these 55 objects are likely background sources. They note, however, that 18 of the 129 unclassified objects (55 identified here for the first time and 74 previously known at radio wavelengths) are compact, have a positive spectral index, or exhibit high variability. Since these latter two properties are not expected of quasars (which are certainly variable, but usually not strongly on such short timescale), but would be natural characteristics of young stars, the authors argue that a small population of YSOs might be present among the unclassified sources. This population could account for, at most, 15% of the unclassified sources, and possibly significantly less.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=vlagbsoph&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/vlagbsoph.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The QORG Catalog aligns and overlays the year 2001/2 releases of the ROSAT HRI, RASS, PSPC and WGA X-ray catalogs, the NVSS (2002), FIRST (2003) and SUMSS (2003) radio catalogs, the Veron QSO catalog (2003) and various galaxy/star reference catalogs onto the optical APM and USNO-A catalogs. This catalog displays calculated percentage probabilities for each optical, radio/X-ray associated object of its likelihood of being a quasar, galaxy, star, or erroneous radio/X-ray association. This table contains the main Master QORG catalog (master.dat) and contains all 501,756 radio/X-ray associated optical objects and known quasars which are optically detected in APM/USNO-A. Up to six radio/X-ray catalog identifications are presented for each optical object, plus any double radio lobes (21,498 of these). These are superimposed (and laterally fitted) onto a 670,925,779-object optical background which combines APM and USNO-A data. Other subsets of this master catalog are available at the CDS, including the Free-Lunch catalog, a concise easy-to-read variant of the Master catalog showcasing just one X-ray and/or radio identification for each object, a subset catalog of QSO candidates, and a subset catalog of known QSOs/galaxies/stars. Objects presented in this catalog are those optical APM/USNO-A objects which are associated with X-ray/radio detections, or any optically-found catalogued QSO/AGN/Bl Lac objects, which have confidence levels &amp;amp;gt;40% of being radio/X-ray emitting optical objects. There are 501,756 objects included in all (including 48,285 catalogued quasars), representing the 99.4% coverage of the sky which is available from the APM and USNO-A. Each object is shown as one entry giving the position in equatorial coordinates, red and blue optical magnitudes (recalibrated) and PSF class, calculated probabilities of the object being, separately, a quasar, galaxy, star, or erroneous radio/X-ray association, any radio identification from each of the NVSS, FIRST and SUMSS surveys, including candidate double-lobe detections, any X-ray identification from each of the ROSAT HRI, RASS, PSPC and WGA surveys, including fluxes and field shifts of those identifications, plus, if already catalogued, the object name and redshift where applicable.

Each of the catalogues contains a large quantity of very high quality astrometric and photometric data. In addition there are associated annexes featuring variability and double/multiple star data, and solar system astrometric and photometric measurements. In the case of the Hipparcos Catalogue, the principal parts are provided in both printed and machine-readable form (on CDROM). In the case of the Tycho Catalogue, results are provided in machine-readable form only (on CDROM). Although in general only the final reduced and calibrated astrometric and photometric data are provided, some auxiliary files containing results from intermediate stages of the data processing, of relevance for the more-specialised user, have also been retained for publication. (Some, but not all, data files are available from the Centre de Donnees astronomiques de Strasbourg.) The global data analysis tasks, proceeding from nearly 1000 Gbit of raw satellite data to the final catalogues, was a lengthy and complex process, and was undertaken by the NDAC and FAST Consortia, together responsible for the production of the Hipparcos Catalogue, and the Tycho Consortium, responsible for the production of the Tycho Catalogue. A fourth scientific consortium, the INCA Consortium, was responsible for the construction of the Hipparcos observing programme, compiling the best-available data for the selected stars before launch into the Hipparcos Input Catalogue.

The aim of this catalog is to provide some basic information on the X-ray sources and their counterparts in other wavelength ranges (gamma-rays, UV, optical, IR, radio). About 60% of the high-mass X-ray binary candidates are known or suspected Be/X-ray binaries, while 32% are supergiant/X-ray binaries. Some sources, however, are only tentatively identified as high-mass X-ray binaries on the basis of their X-ray properties similar to the known high-mass X-ray binaries. Further identification in other wavelength bands is needed to finally determine the nature of these sources. In cases where there is some doubt about the high-mass nature of the X-ray binary this is noted. Literature published before 1 October 2005 has, as far as possible, been taken into account.

The authors have fitted ultraviolet (UV) continua and line emission in each case, enabling them to report common diagnostics of BAL strengths and velocities in the range from -25,000 to 0 km s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; for Si IV 1400 Angstroms, C IV 1549 A, Al III 1857 A, and Mg II 2799 A. The authors calculate these diagnostics using the spectrum listed in the DR5 QSO catalog, and also for spectra from additional SDSS observing epochs when available. They confirm and extend previous findings that BAL QSOs are more strongly reddened in the rest-frame UV than non-BAL QSOs, and that BAL QSOs are relatively X-ray weak compared to non-BAL QSOs. The observed BAL fraction is dependent on the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (S/N); for higher S/N sources, the authors find an observed BAL fraction of about 15%. BAL QSOs show a similar Baldwin effect as for non-BAL QSOs, in that their C IV emission equivalent widths decrease with increasing continuum luminosity. However, BAL QSOs have weaker C IV emission in general than do non-BAL QSOs. Sources with higher UV luminosities are more likely to have higher-velocity outflows, and the BAL outflow velocity and UV absorption strength are correlated with relative X-ray weakness. These results are in qualitative agreement with models that depend on strong X-ray absorption to shield the outflow from overionization and enable radiative acceleration. In a scenario in which BAL trough shapes are primarily determined by outflow geometry, observed differences in Si IV and C IV trough shapes would suggest that some outflows have ion-dependent structure. The authors fit SDSS spectra using the algorithm of Gibson et al. (2008, ApJ, 675, 985), which we summarize here. For QSOs at z &amp;amp;gt;= 1.7, their continuum model is a power law reddened using the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) reddening curve of Pei (1992, ApJ, 395, 130). For QSOs at lower redshifts, the authors use a fourth- or sixth-degree polynomial; in their experience this nonphysical model is able to reproduce well the complex continuum at longer wavelengths. They initially fit regions that are generally free from strong absorption or emission features: 1250-1350, 1700-1800, 1950-2200, 2650-2710, 2950-3700, 3950-4050, 4140-4270, 4400-4800, 5100-6400, and &amp;amp;gt; 6900 Angstroms. They then iteratively fit the continuum, ignoring at each step wavelength bins that deviate by more than 3 sigma from the current fit in order to exclude strong absorption and emission features. They fit Voigt profiles to the strongest emission lines expected in the spectrum: Si IV 1400, C IV 1549, Al III 1857, C III 1909, and Mg II 2799. These wavelengths are taken from the SDSS vacuum wavelength list used by the SDSS pipeline to determine emission-line redshifts.

Correcting for detection incompleteness, the X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of each galaxy is consistent with a power law with negative logarithmic differential slope, Beta, ~ 2.0. However, Beta strongly correlates with incompleteness, indicating the XLF flattens at low X-ray luminosity (L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;). The composite XLF is well fitted by a power law with a break at (2.21 [+0.65,-0.56]) x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;38&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; and Beta = 1.40 [+0.10,-0.13] and = 2.84 [+0.39,-0.30] below and above it, respectively.

Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at frequencies of 4.5 and 7.5 GHz. These observations were mainly focused on the clouds NGC 1333 and IC 348, although the authors also observed several fields in other parts of the Perseus complex. They detect a total of 206 sources, 42 of which are associated with young stellar objects (YSOs). The radio properties of about 60% of the YSOs are compatible with a non-thermal radio emission origin. Based on their sample, the authors find a fairly clear relation between the prevalence of non-thermal radio emission and the evolutionary status of the YSOs. By comparing their results with previously reported X-ray observations, they show that YSOs in Perseus follow a Gudel-Benz relation with a value of the kappa parameter (L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;/L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;rad&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; = kappa x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;(15.5 +/- 1)&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; [Hz]) of 0.03, consistent with other regions of star formation. The authors argue that most of the sources detected in their observations that are not associated with known YSOs are extragalactic, but provide a list in the reference paper Of 20 unidentified radio sources whose radio properties are consistent with them being YSO candidates. Finally, they also detect five sources with extended emission features that can clearly be associated with radio galaxies. The observations were collected with the VLA of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in B and BnA configurations. Two frequency sub-bands, each 1 GHz wide and centered at 4.5 and 7.5 GHz, respectively, were recorded simultaneously. The observations were obtained in three observing sessions, on 2011 March 06/13, April 14/25, and May 01/02/10/19/22, typically separated from one another by a month.

The Chandra data reveal soft (kT&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;e&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ 0.2 - 0.5 keV) diffuse emission in the nuclear starburst region and extending ~ 2&apos; (~ 5 kpc) to the north and west of the nucleus. Much of this soft hot gas is likely to be from local active star-forming regions; however, besides the nuclear region, the morphology of hot gas does not strongly correlate with the bar or other known sites of active star formation. The central ~ 650 pc radius starburst zone exhibits much higher surface brightness diffuse emission than the surrounding regions and a harder spectral component in addition to a soft component similar to the surrounding zones. The authors interpret the hard component as also being of thermal origin with kT&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;e&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ 3.6 keV and to be directly associated with a wind fluid produced by supernovae and massive star winds similar to the hard diffuse emission seen in the starburst galaxy M82. The inferred terminal velocity for this hard component, ~ 1100 km/s, exceeds the local galaxy escape velocity suggesting a potential outflow into the halo and possibly escape from the galaxy gravitational potential. Morphologically, the softer extended emission from nearby regions does not display an obvious outflow geometry. However, the column density through which the X-rays are transmitted is lower in the zone to the west of the nucleus compared to that from the east and the surface brightness is relatively higher suggesting some of the soft hot gas originates from above the disk: viewed directly from the western zone but through the intervening disk of the host galaxy along sight lines from the eastern zone. There are several point-like sources embedded in the strong diffuse nuclear emission zone. Their X-ray spectra show them to likely be compact binaries. None of these detected point sources are coincident with the mass center of the galaxy and the authors place an upper limit on the luminosity from any point-like nuclear source o &amp;amp;lt; 2 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;38&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg/s in the 0.5 - 8.0keV band, which indicates that NGC 2903 lacks an active galactic nucleus. Heating from the nuclear starburst and a galactic wind may be responsible for preventing cold gas from accreting onto the galactic center. NGC 2903, a nearby (8.9 Mpc, 1&amp;amp;quot; = 43 pc) late-type barred SAB(rs)bc galaxy with strong circumnuclear star formation, was observed with Chandra using the ACIS-S instrument in imaging mode on 2010 March 7 (ObsID 11260). The source finding tool in lextrct (Tennant 2006, AJ, 132, 1372) was applied in the energy range of 0.5 - 8.0 keV in order to detect point sources inside the D&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;25&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; isophote. A total of 92 point-like sources were detected with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) above 2.4 (see Tennant 2006) and with a minimum of 5 counts above the background uncertainty.

A central rms of ~ 10 microJy is reached at four frequencies (1.4, 2.5, 5.2, and 8.7 GHz). In this table, the full source catalogs from the 2.5, 5.2, and 8.7 GHz observations are presented to complement the data for the 1.4 GHz observations which were presented in Paper II (Huynh et al., 2005, AJ, 130, 1373, available at the HEASARC as the ATHDFS1P4G table) in this series, along with a detailed analysis of image quality and noise. The authors also have produced a consolidated catalog of all of their ATCA observations of the HDF-S by matching sources across all four of the frequencies in their survey (available at the HEASARC as the ATHDFSCCAT table). The details of the observations and data reduction are discussed in detail in Paper I of this series (Norris et al., 2005, AJ, 130, 1358) and summarized in Table 1 of the reference paper. The observations consist of single pointings centered on RA (J2000.0) = 22&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;h&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; 33&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;m&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; 25.96&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;s&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, Dec (J2000.0) = -60&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;o&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; 38&apos; 09.0&amp;amp;quot; (2.5 GHz), and RA (J2000.0) = 22&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;h&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; 32&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;m&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; 56.22&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;s&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, Dec (J2000.0) = -60&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;o&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; 33&apos; 02.7&amp;amp;quot; (5.2 and 8.7 GHz). The 5.2 and 8.7 GHz observations are centered on the HST WFPC field, while the 2.5 GHz observations were pointed halfway between the WFPC field and a bright confusing source to allow the bright source to be well cleaned from the 2.5 GHz image. At 5 sigma, the 5.2 and 8.7 GHz catalogs have over 96% reliability. At 2.5 GHz, the authors have enough statistics to examine the 5 - 5.5 sigma sources, and find that these are only about 40% reliable. With a SNR greater than 5.5 sigma, the 2.5 GHz catalog would have about 99% reliability. The authors thus cut off the catalogs at 5.5, 5, and 5 sigma for 2.5, 5.2, and 8.7 GHz, respectively. The final catalogs have 71, 24, and 6 sources at 2.5, 5.2, and 8.7 GHz, respectively. Given a prior 1.4 GHz position, it may be feasible to push the detection limit lower than 5 sigma. The authors searched for low-SNR sources by matching 3 - 5 sigma sources that lie within 2 sigma positional uncertainty of a 1.4 GHz source. The positional uncertainty was determined by adding the average 1.4 GHz uncertainty (1.1&amp;amp;quot;) in quadrature with the positional uncertainty of a 3 sigma source. At 2.5 GHz the allowed positional offset is 3.8&amp;amp;quot;, and for 5.2 and 8.7 GHz it is 2.8&amp;amp;quot;. Thus, there are 71, 18, and 2 sources at 2.5, 5.2, and 8.7 GHz, respectively, which are low-SNR high-frequency counterparts to 1.4 GHz sources. The authors included these sources in supplementary catalogs. This HEASARC table contains all 101 primary sources detected at 2.5, 5.2, and 8.7 GHz, as well as the 91 supplementary sources described above (the latter are flagged by having source_flag values of &apos;S&apos;), for a grand total of 192 radio sources.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=athdfs3frq&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/athdfs3frq.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The XMM-Newton survey in the Chandra Deep Field South (XMM-CDFS) aims at detecting and studying the spectral properties of a significant number of obscured and Compton-thick (N&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;H&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt;= 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;24&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;) AGN. The large effective area of XMM-Newton in the 2-10 and 5-10 keV bands, coupled with a 3.45-Ms nominal exposure time (2.82 and 2.45 Ms after lightcurve cleaning for MOS and PN, respectively), allows the authors to build clean samples in both bands, and makes the XMM-CDFS the deepest XMM-Newton survey currently published in the 5-10 keV band. The large multi-wavelength and spectroscopic coverage of the CDFS area allows for an immediate and abundant scientific return. In this paper, the authors present the data reduction of the XMM-CDFS observations, the method for source detection in the 2-10 and 5-10 keV bands, and the resulting catalogs. A number of 339 and 137 sources are listed in the above bands with flux limits of 6.6 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-16&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; and 9.5 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-16&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg/s/cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, respectively. The flux limits at 50% of the maximum sky coverage are 1.8 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-15&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; and 4.0 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-15&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg/s/cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, respectively. The catalogs have been cross-correlated with the Chandra ones: 315 and 130 identifications have been found with a likelihood-ratio method, respectively. 15 new sources, previously undetected by Chandra, have been found; 5 of them lie in the 4-Ms area. Redshifts, either spectroscopic or photometric, are available for ~92% of the sources. The number counts in both bands are presented and compared to other works. The survey coverage has been calculated with the help of two extensive sets of simulations, one set per band. The simulations have been produced with a newly-developed simulator, written with the aim of the most careful reproduction of the background spatial properties. For this reason, the authors present a detailed decomposition of the XMM-Newton background into its components: cosmic, particle, and residual soft protons. The three components have different spatial distributions. The importance of these three components depends on the band and on the camera; the particle background is the most important one (80-90% of the background counts), followed by the soft protons (4-20%). X-ray sources were detected in the 3-Ms XMM-Newton observations of the Chandra Deep Field South. Source detection was done in two steps, first using the PWXDetect software, and then using emldetect. 137 Sources detected in the 5-10 keV band by both programs are presented in the main table, while 61 5-10 keV sources only detected by PWXDetect are presented in the supplementary table. The 2-10 and 5-10 keV bands were analyzed separately. This HEASARC table contains the main sample of 137 sources detected in the 5-10 keV band in the XMM-CDFS survey. (The table of 2-10 keV XMM-CDFS sources is also available at the HEASARC as the XMMCDFS210 table.) This table does not include the 61 supplementary sources which were detected only with PWXDetect. These supplementary sources were on average detected at low significance; many of them were on the borders of the FOV; and a few were in crowded fields where EMLDetect had trouble separating the different PSF components. Nevertheless, 4 of these sources were bright enough that a spectrum could be extracted.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=xmmcdfs510&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/xmmcdfs510.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

Inside the brightest constituent of this large H II region complex is the massive open cluster Pismis 24. It contains two of the brightest and bluest stars known, yet remains poorly studied; only a handful of optically bright stellar members have been identified. The authors have investigated the cluster extent and initial mass function and detected ~800 X-ray sources with a limiting sensitivity of ~ 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;30&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;: this provides the first reliable probe of the rich intermediate-mass and low-mass population of this massive cluster, increasing the number of known members from optical studies by a factor of ~ 50. The high-luminosity end (log L[2-8 keV] &amp;amp;gt;= 30.3 erg s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;) of the observed X-ray luminosity function in NGC 6357 is clearly consistent with a power-law relation as seen in the Orion Nebula Cluster and Cepheus B, yielding the first estimate of NGC 6357&apos;s total cluster population, a few times the known Orion population.

Twenty-four candidate O stars and one possible new obscured massive YSO or Wolf-Rayet star are presented. Many cluster members are estimated to be intermediate-mass stars from available infrared photometry (assuming an age of ~ 1 Myr), but only a few exhibit K-band excess. The authors report the first detection of X-ray emission from an evaporating gaseous globule at the tip of a molecular pillar; this source is likely a B0-B2 protostar. NGC 6357 was observed on 2004 July 9 with the Imaging Array of the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS-I) on board Chandra. Four front-illuminated (FI) CCDs form the ACIS-I, which covers a field of view (FOV) of ~ 17 by 17 arcminutes. The observation was made in the standard Timed Exposure, Very Faint mode, with 3.2 s integration time and 5 pixel by 5 pixel event islands. The total exposure time was 38 ks and the satellite roll angle was 289 degrees. The aim point was centered on the O3 If star Pis 24-1, the heart of the OB association Pismis 24. The Chandra observation ID is 4477. Data reduction started with filtering the Level 1 event list processed by the Chandra X-ray Center pipeline to recover an improved Level 2 event list. To improve absolute astrometry, X-ray positions of ACIS-I sources were obtained by running the wavdetect wavelet-based source detection algorithm within the Chandra Interactive Analysis of Observations (CIAO) package on the original Level 2 event list, using only the central 8 by 8 arcminutes of the field. The resulting X-ray sources were matched to the 2MASS point source catalog. The authors calculated the position offsets between 277 X-ray sources and their NIR counterparts and applied an offset of +0.02&amp;amp;quot; in right ascension (R.A.) and -0.33&amp;amp;quot; in declination to the X-ray coordinates. From an initial list of 910 potential X-ray sources, the authors rejected sources with a P&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;B&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt; 1% likelihood of being a background fluctuation. The trimmed source list includes 779 sources, with full-band (0.5 - 8.0 keV) net (background-subtracted) counts ranging from 1.7 to 1837 counts. The 779 valid sources were purposely divided by the authors into two lists: the 665 sources with P&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;B&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt; 0.1% make up the primary source list of highly reliable sources (Table 1 in the reference paper; sources with source_type = &apos;M&apos; in this table), and the remaining 114 sources with P&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;B&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt;= 0.1% likelihood of being spurious background fluctuations were listed as tentative sources in Table 2 of the reference paper (source_type = &apos;T&apos; in this table).

The revised version of the radio source catalog was published by Hopkins et al. (2003). The primary goal of the PDS is to investigate the properties of star formation in galaxies and to trace the evolution in those properties to a redshift z = 1, covering a significant fraction of the age of the universe. By compiling a sample of star-forming galaxies based on selection at radio wavelengths, Sullivan et al. (2004, the reference paper for this present catalog) eliminate possible biases due to dust obscuration, a significant issue when selecting objects at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths. In this study, they present the catalogs and results of deep optical (UBVRI) and near-infrared (K&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;s&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;) imaging of the deepest region of the existing decimetric radio imagery.

Based on their UBVRIK&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;s&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; imaging, photometric redshift estimates for the optical counterparts to the radio detections are explored.

Deep, multi-color imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope, covering ~ 32% of this Chandra field, was used to search for optical counterparts to the X-ray sources, and the authors have developed a new source classification scheme to determine which sources are likely X-ray binaries, supernova remnants, and background active galactic nucleus candidates.

They find that the XLF of sources associated with older stellar populations has a steeper slope than the XLF of X-ray sources coinciding with young stellar populations, consistent with theoretical predictions. NGC 300 was observed on 2010 September 25 for 63 ks using ACIS-I during the Chandra X-Ray Observatory Cycle 12, observation ID 12238.

As a foundation for the SFiNCs science studies, in the reference paper homogeneous data analyses of the Chandra X-ray and Spitzer mid-infrared (MIR) archival SFiNCs data are described, and the resulting catalogs of over 15,300 X-ray and over 1,630,000 mid-infrared point sources are presented. On the basis of their X-ray/infrared properties and spatial distributions, nearly 8500 point sources have been identified as probable young stellar members of the SFiNCs regions. Compared to the existing X-ray/mid-infrared publications, the SFiNCs member list increases the census of YSO members by 6%-200% for individual SFRs and by 40% for the merged sample of all 22 SFiNCs SFRs. Sixty-five X-ray observations of the 22 SFiNCs SFRs made with the imaging array on the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) were extracted from the Chandra archive (spanning from 2000 January to 2015 April). See Tables 1 and 2 of the reference paper for the list of SFRs and the log of Chandra ACIS observations, respectively. The final Chandra-ACIS catalog for the 22 SFiNCs SFRs comprises 15,364 X-ray sources (presented in Tables 3 and 4 and section 3.2 of the reference paper, and available as the HEASARC table, SFINCSXRAY). To obtain MIR photometry for X-ray objects and to identify and measure MIR photometry for additional non-Chandra disky stars that were missed in previous studies of the SFiNCs regions (typically faint YSOs), the authors have reduced the archived Spitzer-IRAC data by homogeneously applying the MYStIX-based Spitzer-IRAC data reduction methods of Kuhn et al.

       "<tr><td>661</td><td>x-ray</td><td>NGC3293CXO</td><td>ivo://nasa.heasarc/ngc3293cxo</td><td>NGC 3293 is a young stellar cluster at the northwestern periphery of the Carina Nebula Complex that has remained poorly explored until now. The authors wanted to characterize the stellar population of NGC 3293 in order to evaluate key parameters of the cluster population like the age and the mass function, and to test claims of an abnormal initial mass function (IMF) and a deficit of &amp;amp;lt;= 2.5*M&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;sun&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; stars. Thus, they performed a deep (71 ksec) X-ray observation of NGC 3293 with Chandra in which they detected 1026 individual X-ray point sources. These X-ray data directly probe the low-mass (M &amp;amp;lt;= 2*M&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;sun&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;) stellar population by means of the strong X-ray emission of young low-mass stars. The authors have identified counterparts for 74% of the X-ray sources in their deep near-infrared images. These data clearly show that NGC 3293 hosts a large population of ~ 1*M&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;sun&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; stars, refuting claims of a lack of M &amp;amp;lt;= 2.5*M&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;sun&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; stars. The analysis of the color-magnitude diagram suggests an age of ~8-10 Myr for the low-mass population of the cluster. There are at least 511 X-ray detected stars with color-magnitude positions that are consistent with young stellar members within 7 arcminutes from the cluster center. The number ratio of X-ray detected stars in the 1-2 solar mass range versus the M &amp;amp;gt;= 5*M&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;sun&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; stars (known from optical spectroscopy) is well consistent with the expectation from a normal field initial mass function. Most of the early B-type stars and ~20% of the later B-type stars are detected as X-ray sources. These data shows that NGC 3293 is one of the most populous stellar clusters in the entire Carina Nebula Complex (only excelled by Tr 14, and very similar to Tr 16 and Tr 15). The cluster has probably harbored several O-type stars, the supernova explosions of which may have had an important impact on the early evolution of the Carina Nebula Complex. The authors used the Chandra X-ray Observatory to perform a deep pointing of the cluster NGC 3293 with the Imaging Array of the Chandra Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS-I). The 71-ksec observation was performed as an open time project with ObsID 16648 (PI: T. Preibisch) during Chandra Observing Cycle 15 in October 2015 (start date: 2015-10-07 T10:14:23, end date: 2015-10-08 T06:43:28). The imaging array ACIS-I provides a field of view of 17&apos; x 17&apos; on the sky (which corresponds to a scale of 11.3 x 11.3pc at the cluster distance of 2.3 kpc), and has a pixel size of 0.492&amp;amp;quot;. The aimpoint of the observation was RA(J2000) = 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;h&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; 35&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;m&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; 50.07&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;s&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, Dec(J2000) = -58&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;o&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; 14&apos; 00&amp;amp;quot;, which is close to the optical center of the cluster (see Fig. 1 in the reference paper). The pointing roll angle (i.e., the orientation of the detector with respect to the celestial North direction) was 140.19&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;o&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;. In addition to ACIS-I, one CCD detector (CCD 7 = S3) of the spectroscopic array ACIS-S was also operational during this pointing. It covers an 8.3&apos; x 8.3&apos; area on the sky southwest of the cluster center. While the ACIS-I chips are front-illuminated (FI), the S3 chip is back-illuminated (BI), and thus its response extends to energies below that accessible by the FI chips. This causes a substantially higher level of background in the S3 chip. Furthermore, the PSF is seriously degraded at the rather large off-axis angles of the S3 chip. These two effects led to a considerably higher detection limit for point sources in the area covered by the S3 chip compared to the region covered by the ACIS-I array. Nevertheless, the S3 data were included in the data analysis and source detection, and contributed four point sources to the total source list. At the distance of 2.3 kpc, the expected ACIS point source sensitivity limit for a three-count detection on-axis in a 71-ks observation corresponds to a minimum X-ray luminosity of L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;x&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;29.7&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; in the 0.5-8.0 keV energy band, assuming an extinction of A&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;V&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ 1 mag (N&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;H&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ 2 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;21&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;) typical for the stars in the central region of NGC 3293, and a thermal plasma with kT = 1 keV (which is a typical value for young stars). Using the empirical relation between X-ray luminosity and stellar mass and the temporal evolution of X-ray luminosity from the sample of young stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster, which was very well studied in the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (Preibisch et al. 2005, ApJS, 160, 401; Preibisch &amp;amp;amp; Feigelson 2005, ApJS, 160, 390), the authors expected to detect ~90% of the ~ 1*M&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;sun&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; stars in the central region of the young cluster NGC 3293.

It launched 12 August 1977 and was in operation until 9 January 1979. HEAO-1 rotated once per 30 minutes about the Earth-Sun line. In this manner, the instruments scanned a great circle in the sky that lay 90 degrees from the sun. A given source near the ecliptic was viewed for a few days while sources near the ecliptic pole were scanned nearly continuously during the entire mission. The satellite has limited pointing capability that was used to produce this data, giving continuous coverage of selected sources. The pointings began about 100 days into the mission. The A1 instrument, also known as the NRL Large Area Sky Survey Experiment (LASS) covered the energy range 0.25 to 25.0 keV. The experiment consisted of seven detectors, six mounted on the -Y side of the spacecraft, the seventh on the +Y side. Two detectors, with a FWHM of 1 deg x 0.5 deg and open area of 1350 cm2 were tilted a third of a degree either towards or away from the Z (Sun-pointed) four other -Y side detectors has a FWHM of 1 deg x 4 deg and an open area of 1650 cm2. The single +Y detector has a FWHM of 2 deg x 8 deg and an open area of 1900 cm2. The experiment had sufficient sensitivity to detect sources as faint as as 0.25 uJy at 5 keV for sources with a Crab-like spectrum. Data was collected in either a 5 or a 320 millisecond timing resolution mode: Full sky coverage for both time resolutions was achieved before the mission&apos;s end. Wood et al.

Clusters in the catalogue are sequenced in their Right Ascension J2000 order. The Open Cluster Diagrams Atlas (OCDA) presents a set of open cluster diagrams used for the determination of parameters of the 513 open clusters and 7 compact associations, and is intended to illustrate the quality of the constructed cluster membership (Kharchenko et al. 2004, CDS Cat. &amp;amp;lt;J/AN/325/740&amp;amp;gt;), and the accuracy of the derived cluster parameters.

This catalog was used in the INTEGRAL Quick Look Analysis (QLA) to discover new sources or significantly variable sources. The authors compiled several published X-ray and gamma-ray catalogs, and surveyed recent publications for new sources. Consequently, there were 1121 sources in the original INTEGRAL Reference Catalog. In addition to the source positions, an approximate spectral model and expected flux were given for each source, and the expected INTEGRAL counting rates based on these parameters was derived. Assuming the default instrument performances and at least ~10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;5&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; seconds exposure time for any part of the sky, it is expected that INTEGRAL will detect at least ~700 sources below 10 keV and ~400 sources above 20 keV over the mission life. After the launch of INTEGRAL, a version of this catalog was placed on the ISDC website at &amp;amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://www.isdc.unige.ch/integral/science/catalogue&quot;&amp;amp;gt;http://www.isdc.unige.ch/integral/science/catalogue&amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;gt; and has been updated periodically since then by adding, for example, new sources discovered by INTEGRAL itself (indicated by the IGR prefix in the name).

Eleven individual pointings made between 1999 October and 2000 December were combined to generate the final image used for object detection. Catalog generation proceeded simultaneously using two different methods: a method of the authors&apos; own design using a modified version of the SExtractor algorithm, and a wavelet transform technique developed specifically for Chandra observations. The detection threshold was set in order to have less than 10 spurious sources, as assessed by extensive simulations. The catalog as published was subdivided into four sections: the primary list consisting of objects common to the two detection methods, two secondary lists containing sources which were detected by either the SExtractor algorithm alone or by the wavelet technique alone, and the fourth list consisting of possible diffuse or extended sources. The flux limits at the aimpoint for the soft (0.5 - 2 keV) and hard (2 - 10 keV) bands are 5.5 x 10^-17 erg/s/cm^2 and 4.5 x 10^-16 erg/s/cm^2, respectively. The total number of sources is 346; out of them, 307 were detected in the 0.5 - 2 keV band, and 251 in the 2 - 10 keV band. Optical identifications are also presented for the catalogued sources. The primary optical data are R band imaging from VLT/FORS1 to a depth of R ~ 26.5 (Vega). In regions of the field not covered by the VLT/FORS1 deep imaging, the authors use R-band data obtained with the Wide Field Imager (WFI) on the ESO-MPI 2.2 m telescope, as part of the ESO Imaging Survey (EIS), which cover the entire X-ray survey. The FORS1/Chandra offsets are small, ~1 arcsecond. Coordinate cross-correlation finds 85% of the Chandra sources covered by FORS1 R to have counterparts within the 3-sigma error box (&amp;amp;gt;~1.5 arcseconds, depending on off-axis angle and X-ray signal-to-noise). The unidentified fraction of sources, approximately 10% - 15%, is close to the limit expected from the observed X-ray flux to R-band ratio distribution for the identified sample.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=chandfs1ms&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/chandfs1ms.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

These facilitate rapid wide-area imaging via the deployment of simultaneous multiple beams within an ~30 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; field of view. By cycling the array through 12 interleaved pointing positions and using nine digitally formed beams, the authors have effectively mimicked a traditional 1 hours x 108 pointing survey, covering ~150 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; over 711-1015 MHz in just 12 hours of observing time. Three such observations were executed over the course of a week. The authors verified the full bandwidth continuum imaging performance and stability of the system via self-consistency checks and comparisons to existing radio data. The combined three epoch image has arcminute resolution and a 1-sigma thermal noise level of 375 &amp;amp;micro;Jy/beam, although the effective noise is a factor of ~3 higher due to residual sidelobe confusion. From this, the authors have derived a catalog of 3,722 discrete radio components, using the 35% fractional bandwidth to measure in-band spectral indices for 1037 of them. A search for transient events reveals one significantly variable source within the survey area. The survey covers approximately two-thirds of the Spitzer South Pole Telescope (SPT) Deep Field. This pilot project demonstrates the viability and potential of using PAFs to rapidly and accurately survey the sky at radio wavelengths. The target field was observed with BETA on three separate occasions as part of the commissioning and verification of the instrument. The telescope delivers 304 MHz of instantaneous bandwidth and for these observations the sky frequency range was 711-1015 MHz, corresponding to a fractional bandwidth of 35%. The data were captured with a frequency resolution of 18.5 kHz, using 16,416 frequency channels across the band. The PYBDSM source finder was used to extract a component catalog from the deep mosaic image formed from a combination of all epochs and sub-bands. Components were fit to islands of emission that had a peak brightness of &amp;amp;gt;5 sigma and an island boundary threshold of &amp;amp;gt;3 sigma, where sigma is the local estimate of the background noise level. Component spectral indices were assigned by matching positions at which spectral indices were successfully fit (Section 4.5 of the reference paper).

The EUVEBSL database table contains a detailed list of verified bright EUVE sources detected during the survey phase of the EUVE mission (calibration targets are also included). Two distinct surveys, the all-sky and deep surveys, were conducted by the four EUVE telescopes during the first six months of the mission. EUVEBSL contains 356 sources. EUVECAT2 is the 2nd Catalog of EUV objects detected by the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) and published by Bowyer et al. in 1996 (ApJS, 102, 129). The data include (i) all-sky survey detections from the initial 6-months scanner survey phase, (ii) additional scanner detections made later during specially programmed observations designed to fill in low-exposure sky areas of the initial survey, (iii) sources detected with deep-survey telescope observations along the ecliptic plane, (iv) objects detected by the scanner telescopes during targeted spectroscopy observations, and (v) other observations. Plausible optical, X-ray, radio, and/or UV identifications are available for about 65% of the EUV sources. EUVECAT2 contains 801 sources. ROSWFC2RE is the ROSAT Wide Field Camera 2RE Source Catalog. It contains 479 EUV sources found during the ROSAT all-sky survey of July 1990 to January 1991. The information in this database is based on what has been published by Pye et al. (1995, MNRAS, 274, 1165). It supersedes the earlier WFC Bright Source Catalog (WFCBSC), but we have retained the latter in the EUV database for reasons of completeness The ROSATXUV database table is a catalog of XUV sources (Kreysing H.C., Brunner H., and Staubert, R. 1995, A&amp;amp;amp;AS, 114, 465), extracted from observations by the ROSAT Wide Field Camera during the pointed phase. The 5916 WFC pointed observations that were included are from the calibration and verification phase in June 1990 and from the period of pointed observations from February 9, 1991 to July 15, 1994. The catalog contains 1022 independent source detections corresponding to 4 different filters (S1, S2, P1 and P2) and 328 individual sources, many of which were observed repeatedly. Only ROSATXUV detections in the S1 filter band are included in the EUV table. If there are multiple observations of a single source/position in ROSATXUV, then only one entry for that source will be present in the EUV Master Catalog. The EUVERAP1 database table contains the detections of 114 extreme-ultraviolet (EUV; 58 - 740 Angstrom) sources, of which 99 are new serendipitous sources, based on observations covering approximately 8% of the sky which were made with the imaging telescopes on board the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) during the Right Angle Program (RAP). These data were obtained using the survey scanners and the Deep Survey instrument during the first year of the spectroscopic guest observer phase of the mission, from January 1993 to January 1994. The data set consists of 162 discrete pointings whose exposure times are typically two orders of magnitude longer than the average exposure times during the EUVE all-sky survey. The EUVERAP2 database table is a catalog of 235 extreme ultraviolet (EUV) sources, of which 169 are new detections, using the EUVE Observatory&apos;s Right Angle Program (RAP) data obtained with the A, B and C scanners and the Deep Survey (DS) instrument in the period from January 1994 through November 1998. The EUVE RAP used the all-sky survey telescopes (also known as the &amp;amp;quot;scanners&amp;amp;quot;), which were mounted at right angles to the Deep Survey and Spectrometer (DS/S) instruments, in order to obtain photometric data in four wavelength bands centered at 100 Angstroms (Lexan/B), 200 A (Al/Ti/C), 400 A (Ti/Sb/Al or Dagwood), and 550 A (Sn/SiO). The EUVERAP2 catalog covers 17% of the sky and includes observations that were made subsequent to the publication of the first EUVE RAP catalog (EUVERAP1, which listed RAP data that had been obtained up until 1994 January); the data from EUVERAP1, together with additional RAP data obtained through 1994 December, are contained in the EUVECAT2 database table (The Second EUVE All-Sky Catalog of Bowyer et al. 1996, ApJS, 102, 129). Thus, RAP sources detected in 1994 will be contained in both EUVECAT2 and EUVERAP2, albeit different selection criteria were used in the two catalogs. The EUVERAP3 database table is a catalog of 76 extreme ultraviolet (EUV) sources, of which 63 are new detections, using the EUVE&apos;s RAP data. This catalog concentrates on observations made in the last years of the RAP, 1999 and 2000, with a sky coverage of 7% of the sky. The EUVEXRTCAT database table is a catalog of 534 objects detected jointly in the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) (100 Angstrom (AA) band) All-Sky Survey and in the ROSAT X-ray Telescope (XRT) (0.25 keV band) All-Sky Survey. The joint selection criterion within a 1.5 arcminute positional tolerance permitted the use of a low count rate threshold in each survey. This low threshold was roughly 60% of the threshold used in the previous EUVE all-sky surveys, and 166 of the objects listed in this table were new EUV sources, appearing neither in the Second EUVE Source Catalog nor in the ROSAT Wide Field Camera Second Catalog. Preliminary identifications are offered for 105 of the 166 sources not previously reported in any EUV catalog: by far the most numerous (81) of the identifications are late-type (F-M) stars, while 18 are other stellar types, only 5 are white dwarfs, and none are extragalactic. The paucity of WDs and extragalactic objects may be explained by a strong horizon effect wherein interstellar absorption strongly limits the effective new-source search volume, and, thereby, selectively favors low-luminosity nearby sources over more luminous but distant objects. Notice that, with the adopted 1.5 arcminute acceptance criterion, about 50 spurious detections are expected.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=euv&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/euv.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The principal activity of IRAM is the study of cold matter (molecular gas and dust) in the solar system, in our Galaxy, and out to cosmological distances, in order to determine its composition, density, mass, temperature, and kinematics. IRAM operates two observatories at millimeter wavelengths which are open to the international astronomical community: the 30-m single-dish telescope on Pico Veleta (2850 m), Spain, and the six-antenna interferometer on the Plateau de Bure (2550 m) in France. Both sites are at high altitude to reduce the absorption by water vapor. The observatories are supported by the IRAM offices and laboratories in Granada and Grenoble.

The new Hipparcos astrometric catalog has been checked for the quality of the data and the consistency of the formal errors as well as the possible presence of error correlations. The differences with the earlier publication of the Hipparcos Catalog are explained in the reference paper. The internal errors are followed through the reduction process, and the external errors are investigated on the basis of a comparison with radio observations of a small selection of stars, and the distribution of negative parallaxes. Error correlation levels are investigated and the reduction by more than a factor 10 as obtained in the new catalog is explained. The formal errors on the parallaxes for the new catalog are confirmed. The presence of a small amount of additional noise, though unlikely, cannot be ruled out. The new reduction of the Hipparcos astrometric data provides an improvement by a factor 2.2 in the total weight compared to the Hipparcos catalog published in 1997, and, according to the author, provides much improved data for a wide range of studies on stellar luminosities and local galactic kinematics. Note that this catalog version is slightly different from the one published in the book, as an error that sometimes affected the goodness of fit value for the solution was corrected. The first version of these data archived at the CDS (between June and 15 September 2008) also contained errors which were corrected after this date.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=hipnewcat&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/hipnewcat.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

Radio observations obtained in 2011 and 2014 have been used to derive proper motions of eight young stars near Sgr A*. The accuracy of proper motion estimates based on NIR observations by Lu et al. (2009, ApJ, 690, 1463) and Paumard et al. (2006, ApJ, 643, 1011) have been investigated by using their proper motions to predict the 2014 epoch positions of NIR stars and comparing the predicted positions with those of radio counterparts in the 2014 radio observations. Predicted positions from Lu et al. show an rms scatter of 6 milliarcseconds (mas) relative to the radio positions, while those from Paumard et al. show rms residuals of 20 mas. In the reference paper, the authors also determine the mass-loss rates of 11 radio stars, finding rates that are on average ~2 times smaller than those determined from model atmosphere calculations and NIR data. Clumpiness of ionized winds would reduce the mass loss rate of WR and O stars by additional factors of 3 and 10, respectively. One important implication of this is a reduction in the expected mass accretion rate onto Sgr A* from stellar winds by nearly an order of magnitude to a value of a few x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-7&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; solar masses per year. The authors carried out A-array observations of the Galactic center region (VLA program 14A-232) in the Ka (9 mm, 34.5 GHz) band on 2014 March 9 in which they detected 318 compact radio sources within 30&amp;amp;quot; of Sgr A*. The authors searched for NIR counterparts to these compact radio sources using high-angular resolution AOs-assisted imaging observations acquired with the VLT/NACO. A K&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;s&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;-band (central wavelength 2.18 micron) image was obtained in a rectangular dither pattern on 2012 September 12.

The image of this field made at 46 MHz reaches a noise level of 8 mJy beam&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, making it the deepest image ever obtained at this frequency. In total, the authors detect 367 sources in the 3C 295 46-MHz field image, covering an area of 30.5 square degrees out to a primary-beam attenuation factor of 0.4. From these and simultaneous observations made at other low-band frequencies, the authors derive Euclidean-normalized differential source counts. The 62-MHz source counts agree with previous GMRT 153 MHz and Very Large Array 74 MHz differential source counts, scaling with a spectral index of -0.7. The authors find that a spectral index scaling of -0.5 is required to match up the LOFAR 34 MHz source counts. This result is also in agreement with source counts from the 38 MHz 8C survey, indicating that the average spectral index of radio sources flattens toward lower frequencies. The authors also find evidence for spectral flattening using the individual flux measurements of sources between 34 and 1400 MHz and by calculating the spectral index averaged over the source population. To select ultra-steep spectrum (alpha &amp;amp;lt; -1.1) radio sources that could be associated with massive high-redshift radio galaxies, the authors compute spectral indices between 62 MHz, 153 MHz, and 1.4 GHz for sources in the Bootes field. They cross-correlate these radio sources with optical and infrared catalogs and fit the spectral energy distribution to obtain photometric redshifts. They find that most of these ultra-steep spectrum sources are located in the 0.7 &amp;amp;lt;~ z &amp;amp;lt;~ 2.5 range. The Bootes and 3C 295 fields were simultaneously observed on 2012 April 12 as part of a multi-beam observation with the LOFAR LBA stations. The idea behind the multi-beam setup was to use the 3C 295 observations as a calibrator field to transfer the gain amplitudes to the (target) Bootes field. The pointing center of the 3C 295 field was J2000.0 RA, Dec = 14&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;h&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; 11&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;m&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; 20.9&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;s&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, +52&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;o&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; 13&apos; 55&amp;amp;quot;. The total integration time on both fields was 10.25 hr. The &apos;46-MHz&apos; observing band for the 3C 295 field observations was from 40 - 54 MHz, with 25 sub-bands more or less evenly distributed within this frequency range, with a total bandwidth of 4.9 MHz. The synthesized beam for this observation had dimensions of 40 arcseconds x 24 arcseconds.

However, the importance of this mode of star formation is uncertain. This investigation seeks to quantify triggered star formation (TSF) in IC 1396A (aka the Elephant Trunk Nebula), a bright-rimmed cloud (BRC) on the periphery of the nearby giant HII region IC 1396 produced by the Trumpler 37 cluster. X-ray selection of young stars from Chandra X-ray Observatory data is combined with existing optical and infrared surveys to give a more complete census of the TSF population. Over 250 young stars in and around IC 1396A are identified; this doubles the previously known population. A spatio-temporal gradient of stars from the IC 1396A cloud towards the primary ionizing star HD 206267 is found. The current project consists of two Chandra-ACIS X-ray observations of IC 1396A, a Guaranteed Time observation (ObsID No. 11807 obtained on 2010 March 31; PI: Garmire) and a Guest Observer observation (ObsID No. 10990 obtained on 2010 June 9; PI: Getman). Both observations were pointed at the head of the globule but had different roll angles. For each observation, the authors considered only results arising from the imaging array (ACIS-I) of four abutted 1024 x 1024 pixel front-side illuminated charge-coupled devices (CCDs) covering about 17 x 17 arcmin&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; on the sky, Similar to the Chandra catalog of X-ray sources in the Carina Nebula (Broos et al. 2011, ApJS, 194, 2), this list of candidate sources in IC 1396A is trimmed to omit sources with fewer than 3 total source counts (the sum of the net counts and the background counts, NC + BC &amp;amp;lt; 3) and the probability for being a background fluctuation greater than 1% (prob_no_src &amp;amp;gt; 0.01). The final catalog comprises 415 X-ray sources, roughly half of which sources are extragalactic with extremely optically faint counterparts (Section 3.2 of the reference paper), and the rest are young stars associated with the Trumpler 37 and IC 1396A star-forming regions.

Two 4Shooter fields were taken to cover an ~45 x 25 arcmin&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; area centered on the star HD 206267. The FLWO fields contain the whole ACIS field, except for a small gap in between the four CCDs of 4Shooter. All but a few Chandra stars were observed in 2000 September. UVR&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;J&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; I&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;J&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; observations of Trumpler 37/IC 1396A were obtained in service mode during three nights in 2007 June 9-11 using the wide-field camera, LAICA, mounted on the 3.5-m telescope in Calar Alto, Spain. LAICA is a 2 x 2 mosaic of four CCDs, each covering a 15.3 x 15.3 arcmin&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; field of view (FOV) with a large gap of 15.3 x 15.3 arcmin&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; in between. The project combines four LAICA pointings covering an ~45 x 45 arcmin&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; area around HD 206267, including nearly the entire ACIS field. The Spitzer observation was obtained on 2003 December 20 with the IRAC detector in all four IRAC channels (3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8.0 micron). Two adjacent fields subtending ~37 x 42 arcmin&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; in channel pairs 3.6/5.8 micron and 4.5/8.0 micron were centered on Trumpler 37. To reduce unnecessary data processing the authors analyzed only a portion of the original data that encompassed the Chandra-ACIS field with a coverage of ~19 x 19 arcmin&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; area in all four channels centered on Rim A of the IC 1396A globule. This covers 93% of the ACIS field omitting its north-western and south-western edges. An automated cross-correlation between the Chandra source positions and the optical-IR source positions was made using a search radius of 2 arcseconds within ~6 arcminutes of the ACIS field center, and a search radius of 3.5 arcseconds in the outer regions of the ACIS field where the X-ray source positions are more uncertain due to the deterioration of the Chandra telescope PSF. This was followed by a careful visual examination of each source in both bands to remove dubious sources and associations.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=ic1396acxo&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/ic1396acxo.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

This quasar sample was compiled in the following steps: 1. Candidate objects for the catalog were selected as any SDSS DR5 quasar that lie within 20 arcminutes of the center of the Swift FOV in any pointing from launch through 2008 June. 2. XRT data were processed to obtain X-ray count rates, spectra, and spectral parameters. 3. UVOT data were processed to obtain UV and optical photometry. 4. UVOT photometry were supplemented with measurements at other wavelengths from published catalogs. 5. Quasar SEDs were constructed. 6. Additional parameters were calculated based on the SEDs of each quasar. The raw sample is constructed by matching 3.5 years Swift pointings and the SDSS DR5 quasar catalog and contains 1034 objects. This HEASARC version of this catalog contains all 1034 objects in the &amp;amp;quot;raw&amp;amp;quot; catalog.

The Ginga experiment began on day 36, 5 February 1987 and ended in November 1991. Ginga consisted of the LAC, the all-sky monitor (ASM) and the gamma-ray burst detector (GBD). The satellite was in a circular orbit at 31 degree inclination with apogee 670 km and perigee 510 km, and with a period of 96 minutes. A Ginga observation consisted of varying numbers of major frames which had lengths of 4, 32, or 128 seconds, depending on the setting of the bitrate. Each GINGALOG database entry is the first record of a series of observations having the same values of &amp;amp;quot;ACS MONITOR&amp;amp;quot; (Attitude Control System). When this value changes, a new FITS file was written. The other Ginga catalog database, GINGAMODE is also a subset of the same LAC dump file used to create GINGALOG. GINGAMODE contains a listing whenever any of the following changes: &amp;amp;quot;BITRATE&amp;amp;quot;, &amp;amp;quot;LACMODE&amp;amp;quot;, &amp;amp;quot;DISCRIMINATOR&amp;amp;quot;, or &amp;amp;quot;ACS MONITOR&amp;amp;quot;.

The X-ray cluster candidates were selected as serendipitously detected sources from the 2XMMi-DR3 catalog that were located in the footprint of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-DR7). The cluster galaxies with available spectroscopic redshifts were selected from the SDSS-DR10. The authors developed an algorithm for identifying the cluster candidates that are associated with spectroscopically targeted luminous red galaxies and for constraining the cluster spectroscopic redshift. A cross-correlation of the constructed cluster sample with published optically selected cluster catalogs yielded 264 systems with available redshifts. The present redshift measurements (presented in reference paper III) are consistent with the published values. The current cluster sample extends the optically confirmed cluster sample from the authors&apos; cluster survey by 67 objects. Moreover, it provides spectroscopic confirmation for 78 clusters among their published cluster sample, which previously had only photometric redshifts. Of the new cluster sample that comprises 67 systems, 55 objects are newly X-ray discovered clusters and 52 systems are sources newly discovered as galaxy clusters in optical and X-ray wavelengths. Based on the measured redshifts and the fluxes given in the 2XMMi-DR3 catalogue, the authors have estimated the X-ray luminosities and masses of the cluster sample. This table contains 145 entries, 67 of which are new (as of Paper III) optically confirmed clusters (marked by values of ref_source = &apos;Paper III&apos;) and 78 of which are clusters from Paper II which have now been spectroscopically confirmed (marked by values of ref_source = &apos;Paper II&apos;).

The logarithmic slope of the differential XLF (dN/dL), beta = 2.7 +/- 0.5, is marginally (~2.5 sigma) steeper than has been found for analogous completeness-corrected fits of other early-type galaxies but closely matches the behavior seen at high luminosities in these systems.

This study shows strong evidence for dynamic activities in the interstellar medium, which are most likely driven by supernova explosions in the galactic disk and bulge. Understanding these activities can have strong implications for studying the evolution of such galaxies. The authors utilized Chandra, Hubble Space Telescope, and Spitzer data as well as ground-based observations to characterize the content, structure, and physical state of the medium and its interplay with the stellar component in NGC 5866.

These data allow complete coverage of the galaxy with high sensitivity to soft sources such as diffuse hot gas and supernova remnants (SNRs). In the reference paper, the authors describe the methods they used to identify and characterize 1296 point sources in the 8 fields. They compare their resulting source catalog to the literature, note variable sources, construct hardness ratios, classify soft sources, analyze the source density profile, and measure the X-ray luminosity function (XLF). As a result of the large effective area of XMM-Newton below 1 keV, the survey contains many new soft X-ray sources. The radial source density profile and XLF for the sources suggest that only ~15% of the 391 bright sources with L &amp;amp;gt; 3.6 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;35&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; are likely to be associated with M33, and more than a third of these are known SNRs. The log(N)-log(S) distribution, when corrected for background contamination, is a relatively flat power law with a differential index of 1.5, which suggests that many of the other M33 sources may be high-mass X-ray binaries.

Aimed at producing a reliable compact source survey, the authors&apos; automated data-reduction pipeline efficiently processed more than 2000 hours of observations with minimal human interaction. Through application of innovative techniques such as image-based flagging, direction-dependent calibration of ionospheric phase errors, correcting for systematic offsets in antenna pointing, and improving the primary beam model, the authors created good quality images for over 95% of the 5,336 pointings. This data release covers 36,900 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; (or 3.6 pi steradians) of the sky between -53 and +90 degrees Declination, which is 90% of the total sky. The majority of pointing images has a noise level below 5 mJy/beam (the median RMS background noise is 3.5 mJy per beam), with an approximate resolution of 25&amp;amp;quot; x 25&amp;amp;quot; (or 25&amp;amp;quot; x 25&amp;amp;quot;/cos(Dec-19&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;o&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;) for pointings south of 19 degrees Declination). The authors have produced a catalog of 0.62 Million radio sources with flux densities ranging from 11.1 mJy to 9.22 kJy that are derived from an initial, high-reliability source extraction at the 7-sigma level. For the bulk of the survey, the measured overall astrometric accuracy is better than 2 arcseconds in Right Ascension and Declination, while the flux density accuracy is estimated at approximately 10%. Within the scope of the TGSS Alternative Data Release (TGSS ADR) project, the source catalog, as well as 5,336 mosaic images (5 x 5 degree&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;) and an image cutout service, are made publicly available as a service to the astronomical community.

In addition to enabling a wide range of different scientific investigations, the authors anticipate that these survey products will provide a solid reference for various new low-frequency radio aperture array telescopes (LOFAR, LWA, MWA, SKA-low), and can play an important role in characterizing the epoch-of-reionization (EoR) foreground. The TGSS ADR project aims at continuously improving the quality of the survey data products. Near-future improvements include replacement of bright source snapshot images with archival targeted observations, using new observations to fill the holes in sky coverage and to replace very poor quality observational data, and an improved flux calibration strategy for less severely affected observational data.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=gmrtas150m&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/gmrtas150m.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

Each of the 3,170 pointings will be observed for 8 hours, which, at most declinations, is sufficient to produce ~5-arcsec resolution images with a sensitivity of ~0.1 mJy/beam and accomplish the main scientific aims of the survey which are to explore the formation and evolution of massive black holes, galaxies, clusters of galaxies and large-scale structure. Due to the compact core and long baselines of LOFAR, the images provide excellent sensitivity to both highly extended and compact emission. For legacy value, the data are archived at high spectral and time resolution to facilitate sub-arcsecond imaging and spectral line studies. In this paper, The authors provide an overview of the LoTSS. They outline the survey strategy, the observational status, the current calibration techniques, a preliminary data release, and the anticipated scientific impact. The preliminary images that they have released were created using a fully-automated but direction-independent calibration strategy and are significantly more sensitive than those produced by any existing large-area low-frequency survey. In excess of 44,000 sources are detected in the images that have a resolution of 25-arcseconds, typical noise levels of less than 0.5 mJy/beam, and cover an area of 381 square degrees in the region of the HETDEX Spring Field (Right Ascension 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;h&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; 45&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;m&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; 00&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;s&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; to 15&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;h&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; 30^m ^00&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;s&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; and Declination +45&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;o&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; 00&apos; 00&amp;amp;quot; to +57&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;o&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; 00&apos; 00&amp;amp;quot;). Source detection on the mosaics that are centered on each pointing was performed with PyBDSM (See &amp;amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://www.astron.nl/citt/pybdsm/&quot;&amp;amp;gt;http://www.astron.nl/citt/pybdsm/&amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;gt; for more details). In an effort to minimize contamination from artifacts, the catalog was created using a conservative 7-sigma detection threshold. Furthermore, as the artifacts are predominantly in regions surrounding bright sources, the authors utilized the PyBDSM functionality to decrease the size of the box used to calculate the local noise when close to bright sources, which has the effect of increasing the estimated noise level in these regions. Their catalogs from each mosaic are merged to create a final catalogue of the entire HETDEX Spring Field region. During this process, the authors remove multiple entries for sources by only keeping sources that are detected in the mosaic centered on the pointing to which the source is closest to the center. In the catalog, they provide the type of source, for which they used PyBDSM to distinguish isolated compact sources, large complex sources, and sources that are within an island of emission that contains multiple sources. In addition, they attempted to distinguish between sources that are resolved and unresolved in their images. The authors have provided a preliminary data release from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS). This release contains 44,500 sources which were detected with a signal in excess of seven times the local noise in their 25&amp;amp;quot; resolution images. The noise varies across the surveyed region but is typically below 0.5 mJy/beam and the authors estimate the catalog to be 90% complete for sources with flux densities in excess of 3.9 mJy/beam.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=lotssprcat&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/lotssprcat.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

Based on their relative brightness between survey bands, the authors classify the sources into two populations, one dominated by synchrotron emission from active galactic nuclei, and one dominated by thermal emission from dust-enshrouded star-forming galaxies. They find 1,238 synchrotron and 307 dusty sources. The authors cross-match all sources against external catalogs and find 189 unidentified synchrotron sources and 189 unidentified dusty sources. The dusty sources without counterparts are good candidates for high-redshift, strongly lensed sub-millimeter galaxies. The authors derive number counts for each population from 1 Jy down to roughly 11, 4, and 11 mJy at 95, 150, and 220 GHz, respectively. They compare these counts with galaxy population models and find that none of the models they consider for either population provide a good fit to the measured counts in all three bands. The disparities imply that these measurements will be an important input to the next generation of millimeter-wave extragalactic source population models.

A deep source extraction routine, exploiting the low background rates of Chandra observations was employed to maximize the number of sources extracted. Observations at other wavelengths were used to identify low count-rate sources and remove likely spurious sources. Monte Carlo simulations were also used to assess the authenticity of these sources. X-ray spectra were fitted with thermal plasma models to characterize the objects and X-ray light curves were analyzed to determine their variability. The authors used a Bayesian technique to identify optical or near-IR counterparts for 1501 (89%) of our sources, using deep observations from the INT Photometric H-alpha Survey, the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), and the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey-Galactic Plane Survey. 755 (45%) of these objects have six-band r&apos;, H-alpha, i&apos;, J, H, and K optical and near-IR photometry. From an analysis of the Poisson false-source probabilities for each source they estimate that their X-ray catalog includes &amp;amp;lt;1% of false sources, and an even lower fraction when only sources with optical or near-IR associations are considered. A Monte Carlo simulation of the Bayesian matching scheme allows this method to be compared to more simplified matching techniques and enables the various sources of error to be quantified. The catalog of 1696 objects presented here includes X-ray broad-band fluxes, spectral model fits, and optical and near-IR photometry in what is one of the largest X-ray catalogs of a single SFR to date.

Despite the large interstellar reddening towards Cyg OB2, many studies, spanning a wide range of wavelengths, have been conducted to more clearly understand this association. X-ray observations provide a powerful tool to overcome the effect of interstellar absorption and study the most energetic processes associated with the stars in Cyg OB2. The author analyses XMM-Newton data to investigate the X-ray and UV properties of massive O-type stars as well as low-mass pre-main sequence stars in Cyg OB2. Six XMM-Newton observations of the core of Cyg OB2 were obtained. In the analysis, the author paid particular attention to the variability of the X-ray bright OB stars, especially the luminous blue variable candidate Cyg OB2 #12. He found that X-ray variability is quite common among the stars in Cyg OB2. While short-term variations are restricted mostly to low-mass pre-main sequence stars, one third of the OB stars display long-term variations. The X-ray flux of CygO B2 #12 varies by 37%, over timescales from days to years, while its mean log L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;/L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;bol&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; amounts to -6.10.

Some sources, however, are only tentatively identified as low-mass X-ray binaries on the basis of their X-ray properties being similar to the known low-mass X-ray binaries. Further identification in other wavelength bands is needed to finally determine the nature of these sources.

Using a likelihood ratio method on optical, near-infrared or mid-infrared catalogs, the authors assigned counterparts to 401 out of the 409 X-ray sources of the XMM-Newton catalog (Brunner et al. 2008, A&amp;amp;amp;A, 479, 283). Accurate photometry was collected for all the sources from U to 24 microns. The authors used X-ray and optical criteria to remove any normal galaxies, galactic stars, or X-ray clusters among them and studied the multi-wavelength properties of the remaining 377 AGN in their paper. They used a mid-IR colour-colour selection to understand the AGN contribution to the optical and infrared emission. Using this selection, they identified different behaviours of AGN-dominated and host-dominated sources in X-ray-optical-infrared color-color diagrams. More specifically, the AGN-dominated sources show a clear trend in the f&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;x&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;/f&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;RC&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; vs. R&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;C&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; - K and f&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;24um&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;/f&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;RC&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; vs. R&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;C&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; - K diagrams, while the hosts follow the behaviour of non-X-ray detected galaxies. In the optical-near-infrared color-magnitude diagram, the known trend of redder objects to be more obscured in X-rays is seen to be stronger for AGN-dominated than for host-dominated systems. This is an indication that the trend is more related to the AGN, which contaminate the overall colors, than to any evolutionary effects, the authors believe. Finally, the authors find that a significant fraction (~30%) of the reddest AGN are not obscured in X-rays. The X-ray observations of the Lockman Hole took place between April 2000 and December 2002 with XMM-Newton. The optical observations of the Lockman Hole were conducted with the Large Binocular Telescope (U, B, V bands) and the Subaru Telescope (R&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;C&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;, I&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;C&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;, z&apos; bands).

The advent of wide-field and high-sensitivity X-ray telescopes such as XMM-Newton now offers the opportunity to observe this low-to-medium L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; population at large distances. This study reports the results of a Galactic plane survey conducted by the XMM-Newton Survey Science Centre (SSC). Beyond its astrophysical goals, this survey aims at gathering a representative sample of identified X-ray sources at low latitude that can be used later on to statistically identify the rest of the serendipitous sources discovered in the Milky Way. The survey is based on 26 XMM-Newton observations, obtained at |b| &amp;amp;lt; 20 degrees, distributed over a large range in Galactic longitudes and covering a summed area of 4 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;.

A total of 1319 individual X-ray sources have been detected. Using optical follow-up observations supplemented by cross-correlation with a large range of multi-wavelength archival catalogs, the authors identify 316 X-ray sources. This constitutes the largest group of spectroscopically identified low-latitude X-ray sources at this flux level. The majority of the identified X-ray sources are active coronae with spectral types in the range A to M at maximum distances of ~1 kpc. The number of identified active stars increases towards late spectral types, reaching a maximum at K. Using infrared colors, the authors classify 18% of the stars as giants. The observed distributions of F&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;/F&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;V&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;, X-ray and infrared colors indicates that their sample is dominated by a young (100 Myr) to intermediate (600 Myr) age population with a small contribution of close main-sequence or evolved binaries. The authors find other interesting objects such as cataclysmic variables (d ~ 0.6 - 2 kpc), low-luminosity high-mass stars (likely belonging to the class of Gamma-Cas-like systems, d ~ 1.5 - 7 kpc), T Tauri and Herbig-Ae stars. A handful of extragalactic sources located in the highest Galactic latitude fields could be optically identified. For the 20 fields observed with the EPIC pn camera, the authors have constructed log N(&amp;amp;gt;S) - log S curves in the soft and hard bands. In the soft band, the majority of the sources are positively identified with active coronae and the fraction of stars increases by about one order of magnitude from b = 60 degrees to b = 0 degrees at an X-ray flux of 2 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-14&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg/cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;/s. The hard band is dominated by extragalactic sources, but there is a small contribution from a hard Galactic population formed by CVs, HMXB candidates or Gamma-Cas-like systems and by some active coronal stars that are also detected in the soft band. At b = 0 degrees, the surface density of hard sources brighter than 1 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-13&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg/cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;/s steeply increases by one order of magnitude from l = 20 degrees to the Galactic center region (l = 0.9 degrees).

This observation with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory was aimed at uncovering the close interacting binaries in Cr 261, and reached a limiting X-ray luminosity of L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ 4 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;29&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; (0.3-7 keV) for stars in the cluster. The authors detected 107 sources within the cluster half-mass radius r&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;h&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;, and they estimate that among the sources with L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt;~ 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;30&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, about 26 are associated with the cluster. They identify a mix of active binaries and candidate active binaries, candidate cataclysmic variables, and stars that have &amp;amp;quot;straggled&amp;amp;quot; from the main locus of CR 261 in the color-magnitude diagram. Based on a deep optical source catalog of the field, the authors estimate that Cr 261 has an approximate mass of 6500 M&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;sun&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;, roughly the same as the old open cluster NGC 6791. The X-ray emissivity of Cr 261 is similar to that of other old open clusters, supporting the trend that they are more luminous in X-rays per unit mass than old populations of higher (globular clusters) and lower (the local neighborhood) stellar density. This implies that the dynamical destruction of binaries in the densest environments is not solely responsible for the observed differences in X-ray emissivity. Cr 261 was observed with the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) on board Chandra starting 2009 November 9 14:50 UTC, for a total exposure time of 53.8 ks (ObsID 11308). The observation was made in Very Faint, Timed exposure mode, with a single frame exposure time of 3.2 s. Kharchenko et al. (2013, A&amp;amp;amp;A, 558, A53) estimate that the radius of Cr 261 is ~ 14.1 arcminutes. This is considerably larger than a single ACIS chip (8 4 x 8 4 arcminute&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;) and therefore the authors placed the center of the cluster (J2000.0 RA = 12&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;h&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; 38&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;m&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; 06.0&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;s&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, Dec = -68&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;o&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; 22&apos; 01&amp;amp;quot; according to Kharchenko et al. 2013) close to the I3 aimpoint so that a larger contiguous part of the cluster could be imaged (see Figure 1 in the reference paper). The CCDs used were I0, I1, I2, and I3 from the ACIS-I array, and S2 and S3 from the ACIS-S array. The authors limited the X-ray analysis to the data from chips I0, I1, I2, and I3. The S2 and S3 chips lie far from the I3 aimpoint, giving rise to large positional errors on any sources detected on them. Such large errors make it hard to identify optical counterparts, and thus to classify the sources. Source detection was done in soft (0.3-2.0 keV), hard (2-7 keV) and broad (0.3-7 keV) energy bands. The CIAO source detection routine wavdetect was run for eight wavelet scales ranging from 1.0 to 11.3 pixels. The wavdetect detection threshold (sigthresh) was set at 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-7&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;. The corresponding expected number of spurious detections per wavelet scale is 0.42 for all four ACIS chips combined, or 3.35 in total for all wavelet scales. The authors ran wavdetect for the three different energy bands and then cross-correlated the resulting source lists to obtain a master X-ray source list. They detected 113 distinct X-ray sources. To check if any real sources were missed, they ran wavdetect again with a detection threshold of 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-6&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, which increased the expected total number of spurious detections to 33.5, and found a total of 151 distinct X-ray sources with more than two counts (0.3-7 keV) in this case. The positions of 7 of the extra 38 sources were found to match those of short-period binaries discovered by Mazur et al. (1995, MNRAS, 273, 59; see Section 3.4). Close, interacting binaries are plausible real X-ray sources, and indeed the expected number of chance alignments between the Chandra detections and the binaries in the Mazur catalog is very low, as discussed in Section 3.5 of the reference paper. It is therefore likely that at least these seven additional sources are real, but given the ~ 34 spurious detections that are expected, the authors do not believe that there are many more real sources among the extra detections. They flagged the sources that are only found for sigthresh = 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-6&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, but kept them in the master source list. This HEASARC table contains the list of 151 X-ray sources found by wavdetect using a detection threshold of 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-6&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; from Table 1 of the reference paper.

This table contains the final catalog of 225 sources. Within the central 9 arcminutes, 68% of the source positions are accurate to 2 arcseconds, making optical follow-up relatively straightforward. The authors construct the N(&amp;amp;gt;S) relation in four energy bands: 0.2-0.5, 0.5-2, 2-5 and 5-10 keV. In all but the highest energy band, they find that the source counts can be represented by a double power law with a bright-end slope consistent with the Euclidean case and a break around 10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1. Below this flux, the counts exhibit a flattening. The 13-hours deep field is centered on the sky coordinates RA(J2000) = 13 34 37.1, Dec (J2000) = +37 53 02.2. The XMM-Newton observations were carried out in three separate revolutions during June 2001 for a total exposure time of 200ks. Approximately 40% of the total observation time was affected by high particle background flares, arising from soft protons hitting the detector. The data were therefore temporally filtered to remove these high-background periods.

The survey is optimized to sample, at high redshifts, the mass range corresponding to T &amp;amp;gt; 5 keV clusters at z = 0. Technically, our survey is the extension of the 160 square degree survey (160d, the HEASARC Browse table called ROSGALCLUS). The authors use the same detection algorithm, thus preserving the high quality of the resulting sample; the main difference is a significant increase in sky coverage. The new survey covers 397 square degrees and is based on 1610 high Galactic latitude ROSAT PSPC pointings, virtually all of the pointed ROSAT data that were suitable for the detection of distant clusters. The search volume for X-ray luminous clusters within z &amp;amp;lt; 1 exceeds that of the entire local universe (z &amp;amp;lt; 0.1). The authors detected 287 extended X-ray sources with fluxes f_x &amp;amp;gt; 1.4 x 10^-13 erg s^-1 cm^-2 in the 0.5 - 2 keV energy band, of which 266 (93%) are optically confirmed as galaxy clusters, groups or individual elliptical galaxies. The paper from which this table is extracted provides a description of the input data, the statistical calibration of the survey via Monte Carlo simulations, and the catalog of detected clusters. The authors also therein compare the basic results with those from previous, smaller area surveys and find good agreement for the logN - log S distribution and the local X-ray luminosity function. This sample clearly shows a decrease in the number density for the most luminous clusters at z &amp;amp;gt; 0.3. The comparison of these ROSAT-derived fluxes with the accurate Chandra measurements for a subset of high-redshift clusters demonstrates the validity of the 400 square degree survey&apos;s statistical calibration.

For each cataloged source various information is available, which includes the celestial coordinates of the source, the count rate, the significance of detection, and the hardness ratio, total aperture counts, exposure time, and start time of the observation. In addition, a set of three GIF &amp;amp;quot;thumbnail&amp;amp;quot; images is available in the broad (0.5 - 12 keV), soft (2 &amp;amp;lt; keV), and hard (&amp;amp;gt; 2 keV) spectral bands centered on the apparent detection. These images are convenient for accessing the quality of the source detection. The current catalog is preliminary, the goal of the catalog authors being to make the SIS source list available as quickly as possible. To accomplish this, they took an incremental approach and placed their &amp;amp;quot;work in progress&amp;amp;quot; on-line, warts and all.

Two processes have been proposed to drive the disk evolution in such cruel environments: (1) gravitational interaction between circumstellar disks and nearby passing stars (stellar encounters), and (2) photoevaporation by UV photons from massive stars. The relative importance of both mechanisms is not well understood. Studies of massive young star clusters can provide observational constraints on the processes of driving disk evolution. The authors investigate the properties of young stars and their disks in the NGC 6357 complex, concentrating on the most massive star cluster within the complex: Pismis 24. They use infrared data from the 2MASS and Spitzer GLIMPSE surveys, complemented with their own deep Spitzer imaging of the central regions of Pismis 24, in combination with X-ray data to search for young stellar objects (YSOs) in the NGC 6357 complex. The infrared data constrain the disk presence and are complemented by optical photometric and spectroscopic observations, obtained with VLT/VIMOS, that constrain the properties of the central stars. For those stars with reliable spectral types, they combine spectra and photometry to estimate the masses and ages. For cluster members without reliable spectral types, they obtain the mass and age probability distributions from R and I-band photometry, assuming these stars have the same extinction distribution as those in the &amp;amp;quot;spectroscopic&amp;amp;quot; sample. The authors compare the disk properties in the Pismis 24 cluster with those in other clusters/star-forming regions employing infrared color-color diagrams. The authors discover two new young clusters in the NGC 6357 complex. They give a revised distance estimate for Pismis 24 of 1.7 +/- 0.2 kpc. They also find that the massive star Pis 24-18 is a binary system, with the secondary being the main X-ray source of the pair. The authors provide photometry in 9 bands between 0.55 and 8 micron (um) for the members of the Pismis 24 cluster. They derive the cluster mass function and find that up to the completeness limit at low masses it agrees well with the initial mass function of the Trapezium cluster. They derive a median age of 1 Myr for the Pismis 24 cluster members. The R-band observations were performed on 2008 April 1 and 6, and the I-band observations were done on 2008 May 1, both using the VIMOS instrument on the VLT. The near-IR photometry in the J, H and K&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;s&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; bands were taken from the 2MASS. The mid-IR photometry at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8.0 um were obtained withe the Spitzer IRAC camera, both from the GLIMPSE I survey and from deep observations of the central Pismis 24 region carried out by the authors on 2006 September 29. The X-ray observations were made by the Chandra ACIS-I instrument and previously published by Wang et al. (2007, ApJS, 168, 100: the HEASARC NGC6357CXO table). The X-ray sources were matched to sources detected in the VIMOS R and I bands based on positional coincidence, using a 1.5 arcseconds tolerance. The accuracy of the optical and X-ray positions was 0.6 and 1.0 arcseconds, respectively. Given the high space density of sources in the central regions of Pismis 24, there may be a substantial number (up to 1/6 of the sources) of &amp;amp;quot;false positives&amp;amp;quot;, according to the authors. This table contains the list of 643 optical/IR counterparts to the Chandra X-ray sources found by Wang et al.

This is a significant enlargement of the known NGC 6530 stellar population with respect to previous optical studies, including H-alpha surveys. They identify 220 X-ray sources with catalogued stars down to V = 17, while most unidentified sources have fainter counterparts. Moreover, they find an infrared counterpart in the 2MASS (CDS. No. &amp;amp;lt;II/246&amp;amp;gt;) Catalog for 731 X-ray sources. The optically identified cluster X-ray sources are found in a band in the H-R diagram above the main sequence, in the locus of 0.5 - 1.5 Myr PMS stars, with masses down to 0.5 - 1.5 solar masses (M_sun). The pointing direction for the Chandra observation was the NGC 6530 cluster center at RA = 18^h 04^m 24.38^s, Dec = -24^o 21&apos; 05.8&amp;amp;quot; (J2000.0). The PWDetect algorithm found 884 X-ray point sources in the ACIS-I image above a detection significance threshold chosen to ensure only 1 spurious detection on the average. The Sung et al. (2000, AJ, 120, 333; CDS Cat. &amp;amp;lt;J/AJ/120/333&amp;amp;gt;) = SCB Catalog of optical objects against which the X-ray point source list was compared doed not cover the easternmost 2.25&apos; of the ACIS FOV (RAs later than 18^h 04^m 52^s), notice, which comprises about 13% of the ACIS FOV. There are 46 detected X-ray sources (5.2% of the total) in the area not covered by the SCB Catalog. A matching distance of 4 times the X-ray error radius or 2.0&amp;amp;quot; (whichever is greater) was used to identify optical counterparts to the X-ray sources, after a systematic shift between the X-ray and optical positions of -0.4&amp;amp;quot; and 1.84&amp;amp;quot; in RA and declination, respectively, was applied. The authors estimate that as many as 28 of their 220 optical identifications may be spurious, preferentially those in the outer parts of the FOV where the positional uncertainties are larger. There are 8792 &apos;good&apos; 2MASS sources in the ACIS FOV. A matching distance of 4 times the X-ray error radius or 1.5&amp;amp;quot; (whichever is greater) was used to identify 2MASS counterparts to the X-ray sources, after systematic corrections of 0.3&amp;amp;quot; and 1.75&amp;amp;quot; in RA and declination, respectively, were applied to the &apos;raw&apos; X-ray positions. There are 13 cases where there are two possible IR counterparts to a single X-ray source, and 2 cases where there are three possible IR Counterparts to a single X-ray source. (Notice that, in such cases, this table contains multiple entries, one for each counterpart, and hence there are 901 entries compared to 884 X-ray sources.) The authors conclude that the plausible number of spurious X-ray-2MASS identifications is between 30 and 50. Overall, there remain 146 X-ray sources with no optical or IR identification.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=ngc6530cxo&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/ngc6530cxo.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The authors assess the spatial distribution and optical properties of their sample and find that the results are consistent with expectations for AGNs. These sources have a mean density of ~38 AGNs per square degree on the sky, and their apparent magnitude distribution peaks at g ~ 20, extending to objects as faint as g ~ 26. The authors test the AGN selection criterion against a large sample of optically identified stars and determine the &amp;amp;quot;leakage&amp;amp;quot; (that is, the probability that a star detected in an optical survey will be misidentified as a quasi-stellar object (QSO) in their sample) rate to be &amp;amp;lt;= 4.0 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-5&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;. They conclude that their sample contains almost no optically identified stars (&amp;amp;lt;= 0.041%), making this sample highly promising for future celestial reference frame work as it significantly increases the number of all-sky, compact extragalactic objects. The authors further compare their sample to catalogs of known AGNs/QSOs and find a completeness value of &amp;amp;gt;= 84% (that is, the probability of correctly identifying a known AGN/QSO is at least 84%) for AGNs brighter than a limiting magnitude of R &amp;amp;lt;= 19. This sample includes approximately 1.1 million previously uncataloged AGNs. The WISE survey is an all-sky mid-IR survey at 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 microns (W1, W2, W3, and W4, respectively) conducted between 2010 January 7 and August 6, during the cryogenic mission phase, and first made available to the public on 2011 April 14. WISE has angular resolutions of 6.1, 6.4, 6.5, and 12.0 arcseconds in its four bands, respectively. The AllWISE data release, which was used for this work, incorporates data from the WISE Full Cryogenic, 3-Band Cryo, and NEOWISE Post-Cryo survey (Mainzer et al. 2014, ApJ, 792, 30) phases, which were co-added to achieve a depth of coverage ~0.4 mag deeper than previous data releases. AllWISE contains the positions, apparent motions, magnitudes, and point-spread function (PSF)-profile fit information for almost 748 million objects. Astrometric calibration of sources in the WISE catalog was done by correlation with bright stars from the 2MASS point source catalog, and the astrometric accuracy for sources in the AllWISE release was further improved by taking into account the proper motions of these reference stars, taken from the fourth USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog (UCAC4, Zacharias et al. 2013, AJ, 145, 44). A comparison with ICRF sources shows that AllWISE Catalog sources in the brightness range of 8 &amp;amp;lt; W1 &amp;amp;lt; 12 mag have positional accuracies to within 50 mas, and half of these sources have positional accuracies to within 20 mas. For more details on the WISE mission, see Wright et al. (2010, AJ, 140, 1868). The authors took all sources from the AllWISE catalog following Equations (3) and (4) from Mateos et al. (2012, MNRAS, 426, 3271) and they require that all of their sources have S/N &amp;amp;gt;= 5 in the first three bands, as recommended in Mateos et al. (2012); as a further constraint, they limit their results to those with cc_flags = &amp;amp;quot;0000,&amp;amp;quot; meaning that the sources are unaffected by known artifacts such as diffraction spikes, persistence, halos, or optical ghosts. In order to characterize the optical properties of their sample, the authors cross-matched it to SDSS-DR12, which is the final data release of SDSS-III (Eisenstein et al. 2011, AJ, 142, 72), within a radial tolerance of R &amp;amp;lt; 1&amp;amp;quot;, obtaining 424,366 matches. To determine the fraction of false positive positional matches (that is, incorrectly correlating an object in their sample with a different SDSS object due to random positional agreement), they performed the same match on a scrambled version of their sample coordinates, determining that less than 1% of other cross-matches are false positive positional matches between the two catalogs. The authors also cross-matched their sample sources with he second release of the Large Quasar Astrometric Catalog (LQAC-2; Souchay et al. 2012, A&amp;amp;amp;A, 537, A99), which contains 187,504 quasars, including radio-selected quasars from the ICRF2, optically selected quasars from SDSS, and infrared-selected quasars from 2MASS, and thus represents a robust sample of quasars over a wide range of wavelengths. They find that 93,403 quasars from LQAC-2 have clean detections. The majority of non-detections are due to sources in LQAC-2 that are too faint, having R &amp;amp;gt;~ 19.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=allwiseagn&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/allwiseagn.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The survey the authors carried out, consisting of four pointings covering around 142 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; of sky in the frequency range 126-173 MHz, does not provide uniform noise coverage but otherwise is representative of the quality of data to be expected in the planned LOFAR wide-area surveys, and has been reduced using recently developed &apos;facet calibration&apos; methods at a resolution approaching the full resolution of the data sets (~10 x 6 arcsec) and an rms off-source noise that ranges from 100 &amp;amp;micro;Jy beam&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; in the center of the best fields to around 2 mJy/beam at the furthest extent of their imaging. In the reference paper, the authors describe the imaging, cataloguing and source identification processes, and present some initial science results based on a 5-sigma source catalog. These include (i) an initial look at the radio/far-infrared correlation at 150 MHz, showing that many Herschel sources are not yet detected by LOFAR; (ii) number counts at 150 MHz, including, for the first time, observational constraints on the numbers of star-forming galaxies; (iii) the 150-MHz luminosity functions for active and star-forming galaxies, which agree well with determinations at higher frequencies at low redshift, and show strong redshift evolution of the star-forming population; and (iv) some discussion of the implications of these observations for studies of radio galaxy life cycles. The NGP field was observed in four separate pointings, chosen to maximize the area of sky covered, with the LOFAR HBA as part of the Surveys Key Science project. These observations used the HBA_DUAL_INNER mode, meaning that the station beams of core and remote stations roughly matched each other and giving the widest possible field of view. The first observation, which was made early on in LOFAR operations, was of slightly longer duration (~10 h) than the others (~8 h). International stations were included in some of the observations in 2014 but were not used in any of the authors&apos; analysis, which uses only the Dutch array. The author were interested in imaging in several separate frequency ranges (which are referred to hereafter as &apos;spectral windows&apos;), since they wanted to be able to measure in-band spectral indices for detected sources. In addition, facet calibrating in different spectral windows could be done in parallel, speeding the processing up considerably. Accordingly, they chose to facet calibrate with six spectral windows, each made up of four bands and thus containing about 8 MHz of bandwidth: &amp;amp;lt;pre&amp;amp;gt; Spectral Nominal Frequency Frequency Range Window (MHz) (MHz) 1 130 126 - 134 2 138 134 - 142 3 146 142 - 150 4 154 150 - 158 5 161 158 - 166 6 169 166 - 173 &amp;amp;lt;/pre&amp;amp;gt; The final source catalog was made by combining the four per-field catalogs. Ideally, the authors would have combined the images of each field and done source finding on a mosaicked image, but this proved computationally intractable given the very large image cubes that result from having six spectral windows. They therefore merged the catalogs by identifying the areas of sky where there is overlap between the fields and choosing those sources which are measured from the region with the best rms values. This should ensure that there are no duplicate sources in the final catalog. The final master catalogue contains 17,132 sources and is derived from images covering a total of 142.7 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; of independently imaged sky, with widely varying sensitivity. Total HBA-band (150-MHz) flux densities of catalogued sources detected using the PYBDSM software and a 5-sigma detection threshold range from a few hundred &amp;amp;micro;Jy to 20 Jy, with a median of 10 mJy. The authors examined all sources in the initial master catalog for associations with sources in other surveys, for rejection as artifacts, and for optical identifications, as described in detail in Section 3.5 of the reference paper. The final outcomes of this process were (a) an associated, artifact-free catalog of 15,292 sources, all of which the authors believe to be real physical objects which is contained in the present HEASARC table, and (b) a catalog of 6,227 objects with plausible, single optical identifications with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) sources, representing an identification fraction of just over 40 per cent. (Note that around 50 sources with more than one equally plausible optical identification are excluded from this catalog; further observation would be required to disambiguate these sources).</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=lofhatlas&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/lofhatlas.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

This field has a unique set of 9-band infrared photometry covering 2-24 micron from the AKARI Infrared Camera, including mid-infrared (MIR) bands not covered by Spitzer. The survey is one of the deepest ever achieved at ~15 micron, and is by far the widest among those with similar depths in the MIR. This makes this field unique for the MIR-selection of AGN at z ~1. The authors have designed a source detection procedure, which performs joint Maximum Likelihood PSF fits on all of their 15 mosaicked Chandra pointings covering an area of 0.34 square degrees. The procedure has been highly optimized and tested by simulations. A point source catalog with photometry and Bayesian-based 90%-confidence upper limits in the 0.5-7, 0.5-2, 2-7, 2-4, and 4-7 keV bands has been produced. The catalog contains 457 X-ray sources and the spurious fraction is estimated to be ~1.7%. Sensitivity and 90%-confidence upper flux limits maps in all bands are provided as well. In their study, the authors searched for optical MIR counterparts in the central 0.25 square degrees, where deep Subaru Suprime-Cam multi-band images exist. Among the 377 X-ray sources detected therein, ~80% have optical counterparts and ~60% also have AKARI mid-IR counterparts. The authors cross-matched their X-ray sources with MIR-selected AGN from Hanami et al. (2012, PASJ, 64, 70). Around 30% of all AGN that have MID-IR SEDs purely explainable by AGN activity are strong Compton-thick AGN candidates. The source catalog contained in this table uses an internal threshold of ML = 9.5 which corresponds to ML&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;empir&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~12 (see Sect. 4.3.3 of the reference paper for more details). In total, 457 sources are detected, of which 377 objects fall in the deep Subaru imaging region (shown in Figure 1 of the reference paper). This catalog is designed to identify X-ray emitting objects in the Chandra/AKARI NEP deep field. Together with the optimized cross-identification procedure, the clear advantage of the catalog is the very high reliability, while the catalog sacrifices completeness for objects with low counts (see Figure 9 in the paper). Only ~1.7% of the objects listed in the source catalog are expected to be spurious source detections. The two sources that have an ML-threshold in the 0.5-7 keV band below 9.5 originate from a 0.5-7 keV single-band source detection run. To quote similar ML values for all objects, the authors list the total 0.5-7 keV ML values from the joint 3-energy band source detection run. The listed counts, count rates, fluxes, and the corresponding uncertainties in the 0.5-7 keV band are taken from the single-band detection run.

The authors also created a low-probability source catalog (not contained in this present HEASARC table): they caution that, due to the significant number of spurious sources in the low-probability catalog, it should NOT be used to select X-ray sources or to increase the sample size of X-ray-selected objects. It can be of interest if the scientific goal requires one to EXCLUDE potential X-ray emitting objects from a sample with a high completeness, since, using this strategy, one accepts those objects that are excluded are not associated with an X-ray-emitting object. The low-probability source catalog (available at &amp;amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/ftp/cats/J_MNRAS/446/911/&quot;&amp;amp;gt;http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/ftp/cats/J_MNRAS/446/911/&amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;gt; as the files lowpscat.dat.gz and lowpscat.fits) has a lower maximum likelihood threshold than the main source catalog (an internal threshold of ML = 5, corresponding to ML&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;empir&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~9.5). This catalog contains 626 detected sources, of which 506 are located within the deep Subaru imaging region. Based on their simulated data, the authors conclude that 19% of all the low-probability source catalog entries are false detections. Considering only the deep Subaru imaging area the spurious source fraction drops to 15%. When using information from this catalog, please cite the reference paper: Krumpe et al.

From 195 X-ray sources, including class I-III pre-main sequence sources and some young brown dwarfs, a total of 71 X-ray flares were detected. The Chandra X-ray Observatory (Weisskopf et al., 2002PASP..114....1W) observed the central region of rho Oph twice with a deep exposure of the ACIS-I array, consisting of four abutted X-ray CCDs. The first observation (here and after, obs. BF) covered the south-east 17.4&apos; x 17.4&apos; area, including cores B, C, E, and F, while the second observation (obs. A) covered the north-west area centered on core A (Loren et al., 1990ApJ...365..269L). This table contains data and the results of spectral and timing analyses on the 195 sources detected in the two rho Oph fields, 9 of which were detected in both fields and are therefore listed twice (A-61=BF-2, A-64=BF-4, A-65=BF-5, A-69=BF-7, A-75=BF-11, A-77=BF-15, A-78=BF-16, A-79=BF-17, and A-81 = BF-19). Sources which flared have multiple entries, with one entry (typically, but not always) listing the properties of the quiescent emission, and additional entries for individual flares which were analyzed separately. For the very faint sources for which the temperatures obtained from X-ray spectral analyses were not constrained, there are typically two entries in this table per source, one of which gives the results of a spectral analysis in which the temperature was fixed at 1 keV (11.6 MK) and the other in which the temperature was instead fixed at 5 keV (58 MK). Thus, there are more entries (306) in this HEASARC table than the number (195) of detected rho Oph X-ray sources.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=rhoophcxo&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/rhoophcxo.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

In addition, dSphs are optimal targets to investigate the nature of dark matter. However, while we begin to have deep optical photometric observations of the stellar population in these objects, little is known so far about their diffuse emission at any observing frequency, and hence on thermal and non-thermal plasma possibly residing within dSphs. In this paper, the authors present deep radio observations of six local dSphs performed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at 16 cm wavelength (2100 MHz frequency). They mosaicked a region of radius of about 1 degree around three &apos;classical&apos; dSphs (CDS), Carina, Fornax, and Sculptor, and of about half of degree around three &apos;ultrafaint&apos; dSphs (UDS), Bootes II, Segue 2, and Hercules. The rms noise level is below 0.05 mJy for all the maps. The restoring beams full width at half-maximum (FWHM) ranged from (4.2 arcseconds by 2.5 arcseconds) to (30.0 arcseconds by 2.1 arcseconds) in the most elongated case. A catalog, including the 1392 sources detected in the six dSph fields, is presented here. In the reference paper, the main properties of the background sources are discussed, with the positions and fluxes of the brightest objects compared with the FIRST, NVSS, and SUMSS observations of the same fields. The observed population of radio emitters in these fields is dominated by synchrotron sources.The authors have computed the associated source number counts at 2 GHz down to fluxes of 0.25 mJy, which prove to be in agreement with AGN count models. The observations presented in this paper were performed during 2011 July. The project was allocated a total of 123 h of ATCA observing time. The spectral setup included the simultaneous observation of a 2-GHz-wide band centered at 2100 MHz with a 1 MHz spectral resolution for continuum observations (recording all four polarization signals). The mapping of the three CDS required a 19 field-mosaic with a total on-source integration time of about 1 hour per field. For Bootes II and Hercules, a 7 field-mosaic with an on-source integration time of about 2 hours per field was chosen, while Segue 2, due to its smaller size,was imaged with a 3 field-mosaic with about 4 hours per field of integration time (with the purpose of maximizing the sensitivity). More precisely, a total of 16.5, 15.0, 17.0, 13.0, 10.9, and 9.6 hours were spent on-source for Carina, Fornax, Sculptor, Bootes II, Hercules, and Segue 2, respectively. The nominal rms sensitivity in each panel for the actual observing time was 36, 38, 35, 25, 28, and 20 microJy for Carina, Fornax, Sculptor, Bootes II, Hercules, and Segue 2, respectively. See Table 1 of the reference paper for the details of the average restoring beam parameters across all mosaic panels for each field of view (FoV). The authors used two automated routines for source extraction and cataloging, which are provided by the SEXTRACTOR package (Bertin &amp;amp;amp; Arnouts 1996, A&amp;amp;amp;AS, 117, 393) and the task SFIND in MIRIAD. In these maps, SFIND and SEXTRACTOR give nearly identical results for astrometry (number of sources and positions), once the threshold parameters in SEXTRACTOR are tuned (the authors found a threshold typically slightly above 5 sigma). The mismatch in positions is random, and about 1 arcsecond on average for all FoVs. This value can be taken as an estimate of the positional accuracy. Photometry on the other hand, gave quite different results for some sources: in the catalog, the authors used the results from SFIND since this was specifically written to analyze radio images, accounting for artifacts and sidelobes. The number of sources in each dSph FoV is reported in Table 2 of the reference paper. Radio sources can be made up of different components. To decide whether nearby sources are separated sources or components of a single source, the authors visually inspected all the fields where either the angular distance, theta, between sources was &amp;amp;lt; 1 arcminute, or the criterion of Magliocchetti et al. (1998, MNRAS, 300, 257: theta &amp;amp;lt; 100 arcseconds x sqrt[S&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;peak&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;/10 mJy]), was satisfied. A more detailed study of the 178 possible multiple sources will be reported in a future paper by these authors.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=atlgds2p1g&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/atlgds2p1g.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

This new population of &amp;amp;gt;~ 50 T Tauri stars and one new embedded protostar is far larger than the previously reported few intermediate-mass and two protostellar members of the cloud. Most of the newly discovered stars have masses of 0.2-0.7 M&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;solar&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;, and 9% - 15% have K-band excesses from inner protoplanetary disks. X-ray properties provide an independent distance estimate consistent with the unusual location of CG 12 &amp;amp;gt;~200 pc above the Galactic plane. The star formation efficiency in CG 12 appears to be 15% - 35%, far above that seen in other triggered molecular globules. The median photometric age found for the T Tauri population, assuming Siess et al. (2000, A&amp;amp;amp;A, 358, 593) isochrones, is ~4 Myr with a large spread of &amp;amp;lt;1 - 20 Myr and ongoing star formation in the molecular cores. The stellar age and spatial distributions are inconsistent with a simple radiation-driven implosion (RDI) model and suggest either that CG 12 is an atypically large shocked globule or that it has been subject to several distinct episodes of triggering and ablation. In their paper the authors report a previously unnoticed group of B-type stars northwest of CG 12 that may be the remnants of an OB association that produced multiple supernova explosions that could have shocked and ablated the cloud over a 15 - 30 Myr period. HD 120958 (B3e), the most luminous member of the group, may be currently driving an RDI shock into the CG 12 cloud. The current project combines four X-ray observations of the globule: &amp;amp;lt;pre&amp;amp;gt; Field ObsID Start Time Expo. R.A. Decl.

There is one primary field (I in Fig. 1 of the reference paper) with ~31 ks exposure directed at the globule&apos;s core and three secondary fields (II, III, and IV in Fig. 1) with ~3 ks exposures positioned contiguously to the north and west of the core. The primary pointing is intended to detect the population of pre-main sequence (PMS) stars forming in the molecular head of the globule. The secondary pointings are designed to locate an older population of stars expected if the present cloud is only the ablated remnant of a larger cloud that experienced sequential star formation triggering events, similar to the sequence of stars found in the authors&apos; Chandra study of IC 1396N (Getman et al. 2007, ApJ, 654, 316, available in Browse as the IC1396NCXO table). Source searching was performed with data images and exposure maps constructed at three spatial resolutions (0.5&amp;amp;quot;, 1.0&amp;amp;quot;, and 1.4&amp;amp;quot; pixel&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;) using the CIAO wavdetect tool. The authors ran wavdetect with a low threshold P = 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-5&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, which is highly sensitive but permits false detections at this point in the analysis. This was followed by visual examination to locate other candidate sources, mainly close doubles and candidate sources near the detection threshold. Using ACIS Extract, photons were extracted within polygonal contours of ~90% encircled energy using position-dependent models of the PSF. The background was measured locally in source-free regions. Due to the very low, spatially invariant ACIS-I background in the Chandra observations of CG 12, there is a one-to-one correspondence between a source&apos;s significance and net counts. Following the procedure of Getman et al. (2007, ApJ, 654, 316), the list of candidate sources ws trimmed to omit sources with fewer than ~5 estimated source net counts, net full-band counts/PSF fraction &amp;amp;lt;~ 4.5. In the case of the CG 12 observations, the above criterion is equivalent to accepting sources with a source significance of &amp;amp;gt;~ 1.1. Thus, most of the statistically insignificant source candidates found during the wavdetect step were eliminated by the application of these source existence criteria. For Chandra sources with &amp;amp;gt; 20 net counts, the authors performed spectral analysis with the XSPEC spectral fitting package version 12.2. The unbinned source and background spectra were fitted with one-temperature APEC plasma emission models using the maximum likelihood method. They assumed 0.3 times solar elemental abundances previously suggested as typical for young stellar objects (YSOs) in other star-forming regions. Solar abundances were taken from Anders &amp;amp;amp; Grevesse (1989, Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta, 53, 197). X-ray absorption was modeled using the atomic cross sections of Morrison &amp;amp;amp; McCammon (1983, ApJ, 270, 119). For absorbed thermal spectra characteristics of PMS stars, the absorption N&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;H&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; can be estimated to roughly a factor of 2 precision for 20 count sources.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=cg12cxo&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/cg12cxo.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

In their first paper (DXRBS-I), the authors discuss their survey methods, identification procedure, and first results. Their survey was found to be 95% efficient at finding flat-spectrum radio-loud quasars (FSRQs; 59 of their first 85 identifications) and BL Lacertae objects (22 of their first 85 identifications), a figure that is comparable to or greater than that achieved by other radio and X-ray survey techniques. The identifications presented therein showed that all previous samples of blazars (even when taken together) did not representatively survey the blazar population, missing critical regions of (L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;, L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;R&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;) parameter space within which large fractions of the blazar population lie. Particularly important was the identification of a large population of FSRQs (&amp;amp;gt;=25% of DXRBS-I FSRQs) with ratios of X-ray to radio luminosity &amp;amp;gt;= 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-6&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; (Alpha&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;rx&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;= 0.78). In addition, as a result of their greater sensitivity, the DXRBS-I already more than doubled the number of FSRQs in complete samples with 5-GHz (radio) luminosities between 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;31.5&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; and 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;33.5&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; ergs/s/Hz, and filled in the region of parameter space between X-ray-selected and radio-selected samples of BL Lac objects. The DXRBS-I was the very first sample to contain statistically significant numbers of blazars at low luminosities, approaching what should be the lower end of the FSRQ luminosity function. In DXRBS-II, the authors presented new identifications and spectra for 106 sources, including 86 radio-loud quasars, 11 BL Lacertae objects, and nine narrow-line radio galaxies. Together with the DXRBS-I objects and already-known sources, their sample now contained 298 identified objects: 234 radio-loud quasars [181 flat-spectrum quasars: FSRQ (Alpha&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;r&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;= 0.50) and 53 steep-spectrum quasars: SSRQ], 36 BL Lacs and 28 narrow-line radio galaxies. Redshift information is available for 96 per cent of these. Thus, the selection technique was ~90 per cent efficient at finding radio-loud quasars and BL Lacs.

The DXRBS-I entries in this catalog (identified by having values of the parameter dxrbs_part equal to 1) contain data for 85 identified sources meeting the authors&apos; selection criteria. A number of sources were serendipitously observed by ROSAT on more than one occasion, and, for completeness, the WGACAT positions and values for these multiply observed sources are listed separately, resulting in 102 DXRBS-I entries in this catalog (71 sources with 1 X-ray observation, 11 sources with 2 X-ray observations, and 3 sources with 3 X-ray observations). The DXRBS-II entries in this catalog (identified by having values of the parameter dxrbs_part equal to 2) contain data for 106 identified sources meeting the authors&apos; selection criteria. A number of sources were serendipitously observed by ROSAT on more than one occasion, and, for completeness, the WGACAT positions and values for these multiply observed sources are listed separately. In one case (1WGA J0513.8+0156&apos;) the source was detected twice by ROSAT and there are two possible optical counterparts: there are 2 entries for each X-ray observation corresponding to the different conterparts, resulting in a total of 4 entries for this source. There are 92 DXRBS-II sources with 1 X-ray observation, 11 sources with 2 X-ray observations, 2 sources with 4 X-ray observations and 1 source with 5 X-ray observations) resulting in 127 DXRBS-II entries for 106 sources in this catalog. Four of the DXRBS-I objects (1WGA J0421.5+1433, 1WGA J0528.5-5820, 1WGA J1057.6-7724 and 1WGA J1222.6+2934) were also included in DXRBS-II as higher signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) spectra were available.

The authors provide X-ray spectral fits and valid uncertainties for all the galaxies with counts ranging from 2 to 1325 (mean 76, median 19). They present in their paper novel constraints that both X-ray luminosity L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; and X-ray spectral energy distribution bring to the galaxy evolutionary sequence HII -&amp;amp;gt; Seyfert/Transition Object -&amp;amp;gt; LINER -&amp;amp;gt; Passive suggested by optical data. In particular, the authors show that both L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; and Gamma, the slope of the power law that best fits the 0.5 - 8 keV spectra, are consistent with a clear decline in the accretion power along the sequence, corresponding to a softening of their spectra. This implies that, at z ~ 0, or at low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN) levels, there is an anticorrelation between Gamma and L/L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;Edd&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;, opposite to the trend which is exhibited by high-z AGN (quasars). The turning point in the Gamma - L/L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;Edd&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; LLAGN + quasars relation occurs near Gamma ~ 1.5 and L/L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;Edd&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ 0.01. Interestingly, this is identical to what stellar mass X-ray binaries exhibit, indicating that the authors have probably found the first empirical evidence for an intrinsic switch in the accretion mode, from advection-dominated flows to standard (disk/corona) accretion modes in supermassive black hole accretors, similar to what has been seen and proposed to happen in stellar mass black hole systems. The anticorrelation the authors find between Gamma and L/L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;Edd&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; may instead indicate that stronger accretion correlates with greater absorption. Therefore, the trend for softer spectra toward more luminous, high-redshift, and strongly accreting (L/L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;Edd&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt;~ 0.01) AGNs/quasars could simply be the result of strong selection biases reflected in the dearth of type 2 quasar detections. The cross-match of all ChaMP sky regions imaged by Chandra/ACIS with the SDSS DR4 spectroscopic footprint results in a parent sample of 15,955 galaxies on or near a chip and a subset of 199 sources that are X-ray detected. Among those, only 107 sources have an off-axis angle (OAA) Theta &amp;amp;lt;0.2 degrees and avoid ccd=8 due to high serial readout noise; these 107 objects comprise the main sample that the authors employ for this study and that are listed in this table. The authors performed direct spectral fits to the X-ray counts distribution using the full instrument calibration, known redshift, and Galactic 21-cm column nH&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;Gal&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;. Source spectra were extracted from circular regions with radii corresponding to energy encircled fractions of ~90%, while the background region encompasses a 20 arcsec annulus, centered on the source, with separation 4 arcsecs, from the source region. Any nearby sources were excised, from both the source and the background regions. The spectral fitting was done via yaxx (&apos;Yet Another X-ray eXtractor&apos;: Aldcroft 2006, BAAS, 38, 376), an automated script that employs the CIAO Sherpa tool. Each spectrum was fitted in the range 0.5 - 8 keV by two different models: (1) a single power law plus absorption fixed at the Galactic 21-cm value (model &apos;PL&apos;), and (2) a fixed power law of photon index Gamma = 1.9 plus intrinsic absorption of column nH (model &apos;PLfix&apos;). For the nine objects with more than 200 counts, the authors employed a third model in which both the slope of the power law and the intrinsic absorption were free to vary (model &apos;PL_abs&apos;).</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=champsdssa&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/champsdssa.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The catalog is assembled from existing observations (especially the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey, CLASS, and the Wright et al.

The authors refer to this program as CRATES, the Combined Radio All-Sky Targeted Eight-GHz Survey. The resulting catalog provides precise positions, subarcsecond structures, and spectral indices for some 11,000 sources. The authors describe the morphology and spectral index distribution of the sample and comment on the survey&apos;s power to select several classes of interesting sources, especially high-energy blazars. Comparison of CRATES with other high-frequency surveys also provides unique opportunities for identification of high-power radio sources. This table contains 14467 entries, where each entry corresponds to an 8.4-GHz counterpart source (or absence thereof) to one of 11,131 4.8-GHz sources. The number of entries exceeds the number of 4.8-GHz sources because there are many cases in which there are multiple (from 2 - 20) 8.4-GHz counterparts to a single 4.8-GHz source.

Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) and the 40m Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) telescope have been used to conduct a 31-GHz survey of 3165 known extragalactic radio sources over 143 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; of the sky. Target sources were selected from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) in fields observed by the Cosmic Background Imager (CBI); most are extragalactic active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with 1.4-GHz flux densities of 3-10 mJy. Using a maximum-likelihood analysis to obtain an unbiased estimate of the distribution of the 1.4 - 31 GHz spectral indices of these sources, the authors find a mean 31 - 1.4 GHz flux ratio of 0.110 +/- 0.003 corresponding to a spectral index alpha = -0.71+/-0.01 (S&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;nu&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ nu&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;alpha&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;); 9.0% +/- 0.8% of the sources have alpha &amp;amp;gt; -0.5 and 1.2% +/- 0.2% have alpha &amp;amp;gt; 0.

In this study, the authors present a detailed characterization of the impact of the discrete source foreground on arcminute-scale 31-GHz anisotropy measurements based upon two observational campaigns. The first campaign (the results of which are given in the OVRO31GHZ table) was carried out with the OVRO 40m telescope at 31 GHz from 2000 September through 2002 December. The second campaign (the results of which are given in the present table) used the GBT from 2006 February to May. A companion paper (Sievers et al. 2009arXiv0901.4540S) presents the five-year CBI total intensity power spectrum incorporating the results of the point-source measurements discussed here. Reported error bars include a 10% and 5% rms gain uncertainty for GBT and OVRO measurements, respectively. Sources detected at greater than 4 sigma at 31 GHz are flagged (detection_flag = &apos;Y&apos;); for this calculation, the random gain uncertainty was excluded. In all 3165 sources were observed. The GBT catalog (this table) contains 1490 sources. Of the 2315 useful OVRO observations many of the non-detections (and a few detections) were superceded by more sensitive GBT observations; the OVRO catalog contained in the HEASARC&apos;s OVRO31GHZ table therefore contains data on 1675 sources. The detection rate of the OVRO measurements was 11%, and that of the GBT measurements 25%. In all, 18% of the sources were detected at 31 GHz.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=gbt31ghz&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/gbt31ghz.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

They perform photometry and simple spectral fitting for our detected sources and construct luminosity functions, X-ray color-magnitude, and color-color diagrams. Eighty-seven X-ray sources show variability on timescales from hours to years. Thirty-one of the new X-ray sources are identified with chromospherically active binaries from the catalogs of Albrow and coworkers (2001, CDS Cat. &amp;amp;lt;J/ApJ/559/1060&amp;amp;gt;). The authors estimate that the total number of neutron stars in 47 Tuc is of order 300, reducing the discrepancy between theoretical neutron star retention rates and observed neutron star populations in globular clusters. The data used in this paper are from the 2000 and 2002 Chandra observations of the globular cluster 47 Tuc. The 2000 observations, initially described in Grindlay et al. (2001, Science 292, 2290), were performed with the ACIS-I CCD array at the telescope focus, while the 2002 observations placed the back-illuminated ACIS-S aim point at the focus for maximum low-energy sensitivity. The authors combined the results from wavdetect source detection runs with a threshold probability of 1 x 10^-5, in two energy bands (0.5 - 2.0 keV and 0.5 - 6.0 keV for the 2000 observations, and (0.3 - 2.0 keV and 0.3 - 6.0 keV for the 2002 observations), to make independent source lists for the 2000 and 2002 observations, given in Tables 2 and 3 of the reference paper, which have been combined in the present HEASARC table. A total of 146 sources were detected in this way in the 2000 observations (entries with dataset_year = 2000), while 300 sources were detected in the 2002 observations (dataset_year = 2002).

This now allows studies of source counts in distant cluster fields. The authors want to analyze the inner region of clusters of galaxies to check for the presence of any over-density of X-ray point sources embedded in the gas diffuse emission. These point sources are possible AGN belonging to the clusters and could contaminate the cluster emission. The authors used a sample of 18 distant (0.25 &amp;amp;lt; z &amp;amp;lt; 1.01) galaxy clusters from the Chandra archive to construct the log N - log S relation, in both the soft and hard energy bands, for the X-ray point sources detected in the central cluster region to be compared with the counts of point sources detected in similarly deep fields without clusters. The authors find a ~2-sigma excess of cluster region sources at the bright end of the log N - log S distribution. The radial distribution of the brightest X-ray point sources confirms this excess and indicates that it is confined to the inner 0.5 Mpc of the cluster region. The results suggest the possible existence of X-ray sources belonging to the cluster (most probably AGN, given their 0.5-10 keV luminosity ranging from 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;43&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; to 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;44&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;): on average one every three clusters. Unlike previous studies, which have mainly investigated the point-source population in the vicinity of the galaxy clusters, the present study analyzes the content of point sources within the 1 Mpc region covered by the cluster extent. This work confirms the findings of other investigators who analyzed the central 1 Mpc region of more massive clusters and/or groups in a similar redshift range. The X-ray source excess found here is much smaller than the excess of radio galaxies found recently in high-z X-ray selected clusters, possibly due to the better sensitivity of the radio observations.

In this paper, the authors utilize this wealth of information and present a uniformly processed data set, which can be used to address a wide range of scientific questions. The data analysis procedures are applied to 10,029 Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer observations, which produces 363,530 source detections belonging to 217,828 distinct X-ray sources. This number is twice the size of the Chandra Source Catalog (Version 1.1). The catalogs in this paper provide abundant estimates of the detected X-ray source properties, including source positions, counts, colors, fluxes, luminosities, variability statistics, etc. Cross-correlation of these objects with galaxies shows that 17,828 sources are located within the D&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;25&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; isophotes of 1,110 galaxies, and 7,504 sources are located between the D&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;25&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; and 2*D&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;25&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; isophotes of 910 galaxies. Contamination analysis with the log N-log S relation indicates that 51.3% of objects within 2*D&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;25&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; isophotes are truly relevant to galaxies, and the &amp;amp;quot;net&amp;amp;quot; source fraction increases to 58.9%, 67.3%, and 69.1% for sources with luminosities above 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;37&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;38&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, and 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;39&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg/s, respectively. Among the possible scientific uses of this catalog mentioned in this paper, the authors discuss the possibility of studying intra-observation variability, inter-observation variability, and supersoft sources (SSSs). About 17,092 detected sources above 10 counts are classified as variable in individual observation with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) criterion (P&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;K-S&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). There are 99,647 sources observed more than once and 11,843 sources observed 10 times or more, offering a wealth of data with which to explore their long-term variability. There are 1,638 individual objects (~2,350 detections) classified as SSSs. As a quite interesting subclass, detailed studies on X-ray spectra and optical spectroscopic follow-up are needed to categorize these SSSs and pinpoint their properties. In addition, this survey can enable a wide range of statistical studies, such as X-ray activity in different types of stars, X-ray luminosity functions in different types of galaxies, and multi-wavelength identification and classification of different X-ray populations. The ACIS observations were downloaded from the Chandra Data Archive on 2014 December 4, yielding 10,047 ACIS observations. Eighteen observations with PI as &amp;amp;quot;Calibration&amp;amp;quot; or Exposure as zero were excluded. Finally, there are 10,029 ACIS observations containing 4,146 ACIS-I observations and 5,883 ACIS-S observations in our sample. The exposure times for the selected observations cover a range from 50 s to 190 ks, with a total of 221,851 ks. This HEASARC table comprises the list of 218,789 X-ray point sources detected in the Chandra ACIS Survey and listed in the machine-readable version of Table 5 from the reference paper. This number is somewhat larger than the number of independent sources (217,828) stated in the abstract and Section 5 of the reference paper because if a source lies within 2*R&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;25&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; of more than one galaxy it is listed multiple times, once for each galaxy with which it may be associated.

(2013). A new 97-ks Chandra ACIS-S observation of NGC 404 was combined with archival observations for a total exposure of ~123 ks. This survey yields 74 highly significant X-ray point sources and is sensitive to a limiting unabsorbed luminosity of ~6 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;35&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg/s in the 0.35-8 keV band. To constrain the nature of each X-ray source, cross-correlations with multi-wavelength data were generated. The authors searched overlapping Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations for optical counterparts to their X-ray detections, but found only two X-ray sources with candidate optical counterparts. They found 21 likely low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), although this number is a lower limit due to the difficulties in separating LMXBs from background active galactic nuclei (AGN). The X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) in both the soft and hard energy bands are presented in the 2013 reference paper. The XLFs in the soft band (0.5-2 keV) and the hard band (2-8 keV) have a limiting luminosity at the 90% completeness limit of 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;35&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg/s and 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;36&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg/s, respectively, significantly lower than previous X-ray studies of NGC 404. The authors find the XLFs to be consistent with those of other X-ray populations dominated by LMXBs. However, the number of luminous (&amp;amp;gt;10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;37&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg/s) X-ray sources per unit stellar mass in NGC 404 is lower than is observed for other galaxies. The relative lack of luminous XRBs may be due to a population of LMXBs with main-sequence companions formed during an epoch of elevated star formation ~0.5 Gyr ago. NGC 404 was observed during Chandra X-Ray Observatory Cycle 12 on 2010 October 21-22 for 97 ks using the ACIS-S array (Obs. ID 12339). The authors additionally utilized archival observations: NGC 404 was observed on 1999 December 19 (Obs. ID 870) for ~24 ks and on 2000 August 30 (Obs. ID 384) for ~2 ks, both using the ACIS-S array. The authors created images in the following energy bands (keV): 0.35-8.0, 0.35-1.0, 1.0-2.0, 2.0-8.0 with bin sizes of 1, 2, 3, and 4. The iterative source detection strategy that was used is described in Section 2.3 of Binder et al. (2012, ApJ, 758, 15). ACIS-Extract (AE) was run a final time on the source list that was produces after an initial run of wavdetect followed by several iterations of AE, and the Poisson probability of not being a source (pns) value was computed in each of the following nine energy bands: 0.5 - 8.0, 0.5 - 2.0, 2.0 - 8.0, 0.5 - 1.0, 1.0 - 2.0, 2.0 - 4.0, 4.0 - 8.0, 0.35 - 1.0 or 0.35 - 8.0 keV. To be included in the final NGC 404 catalog, a source was required to have a pns value less than 4 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-6&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; in any of the nine energy bands. The final CLVS source catalog for NGC 404 contains 74 sources. Given the survey size of these NGC 404 observations, there are expected to be ~1.6 false sources included in this NGC 404 final source catalog. Three HST fields were used to search for optical counterparts for each of the X-ray sources. One field (labeled &amp;amp;quot;DEEP&amp;amp;quot;) was taken as part of the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) Nearby Galaxy Survey Treasury (ANGST, GO-10915; Dalcanton et al. 2009, ApJS, 183, 67), while the other two shallower fields (labeled &amp;amp;quot;NE&amp;amp;quot; and &amp;amp;quot;SW&amp;amp;quot;) were obtained as part of GO-11986.

Suprime-Cam covers a field of view 34&apos; x 27&apos;, a unique facility among the 8-10m class telescopes, with a resolution of 0.202 arcseconds per pixel. The focal plane consists of ten high-resistivity 2kx2k CCDs developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory, which are cooled by a large Stirling-cycle cooler. The CCD readout electronics was designed to be scalable, which allows the multiple read-out of tens of CCDs. It takes 50 seconds to readout entire arrays. A filter-exchange mechanism of the jukebox type is designed that can hold up to ten large filters (205 x 170 x 15 mm^3). The wide-field corrector is basically a three-lens Wynne-type, but has a new type of atmospheric dispersion corrector. The corrector provides a flat focal plane and an un-vignetted field of view of 30&apos; in diameter. The achieved co-planarity of the focal array mosaic is smaller than 30 um peak-to-peak, which realizes mostly the seeing limited image over the entire field. The median seeing in the I_c-band, measured over one year and a half, is 0.61 arcseconds. The PSF anisotropy in Suprime-Cam images, estimated by stellar ellipticities, is about 2% under this median seeing condition. At the time of its commissioning, Suprime-Cam had the largest survey speed, which is defined as the field of view multiplied by the primary mirror area of the telescope, among those cameras built for sub-arcsecond imaging.

A total of 34,522 (~53%) of these clusters have a signal-to-noise ratio S/N &amp;amp;gt; 0 after subtracting the background signal. According to the reference paper (but see HEASARC Caveats section below), this catalog contains 817 clusters (473 at redshift z &amp;amp;lt;= 0.12) with S/N &amp;amp;gt; 3 for their X-ray detections (an additional 12,629 clusters have 3 &amp;amp;gt;= S/N &amp;amp;gt; 1 and 21,076 clusters have 1 &amp;amp;gt;= S/N &amp;amp;gt; 0). The authors find about 65% of these X-ray clusters have their most massive member located near the X-ray flux peak; for the remaining 35%, the most massive galaxy is separated from the X-ray peak, with the separation following a distribution expected from a Navarro-Frenk-White profile. In the reference paper, the authors investigate a number of correlations between the optical and X-ray properties of these X-ray clusters, and find that the cluster X-ray luminosity is correlated with the stellar mass (luminosity) of the clusters, as well as with the stellar mass (luminosity) of the central galaxy and the mass of the halo, although the scatter in these correlations is large. Comparing the properties of X-ray clusters of similar halo masses but having different X-ray luminosities, they find that massive haloes with masses &amp;amp;gt;~10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;14&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; h&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; M&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;sun&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; contain a larger fraction of red satellite galaxies when they are brighter in X-ray.

Multi-resolution radio and optical r-band images (made using the 4 m CTIO Blanco telescope) were used to recognize multi-component sources and prepare a source list of 1366 1.4-GHZ sources; the detection threshold was 0.38 mJy in a low-resolution radio image made with beam FWHM of 50 arcseconds. Radio source counts in the flux density range 0.4-8.7 mJy are estimated, with corrections applied for noise bias, effective area correction, and resolution bias. The resolution bias is mitigated using low-resolution radio images, while effects of source confusion are removed by using high-resolution images for identifying blended sources. Below 1 mJy the ATLBS counts are systematically lower than the previous estimates. Showing no evidence for an upturn down to 0.4 mJy, they do not require any changes in the radio source population down to the limit of the survey. The work suggests that automated image analysis for counts may be dependent on the ability of the imaging to reproduce connecting emission with low surface brightness and on the ability of the algorithm to recognize sources, which may require that source finding algorithms effectively work with multi-resolution and multi-wavelength data. The work underscores the importance of using source lists - as opposed to component lists - and correcting for the noise bias in order to precisely estimate counts close to the image noise and determine the upturn at sub-mJy flux density.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=atlbs1p4gh&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/atlbs1p4gh.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

They used optical variability, among other more standard methods, as a means of identifying a large number of ROSAT All- Sky Survey sources. All objects fainter than about 12th magnitude and brighter than about 17th magnitude in or near the error circle of the ROSAT positions were tested for optical variability on hundreds of archival plates of the Sonneberg field patrol. The reference paper contains probable optical identifications of altogether 256 of the 370 ROSAT sources analyzed. In particular, the authors found 126 active galactic nuclei (some of them may be misclassified cataclysmic variables, CVs), 17 likely clusters of galaxies, 16 eruptive double stars (mostly CVs), 43 chromospherically active stars, 65 stars brighter than about 13th magnitude, 7 UV Ceti stars, 3 semi-regular or slow irregular variable stars of late spectral type, 2 DA white dwarfs, 1 Am star, 1 supernova remnant, and 1 planetary nebula. As expected, nearly all active galactic nuclei are found in the high-galactic latitude field, while the majority of CVs is located at low galactic latitudes. The authors identify in total 72 new variable objects. X-ray emission is, not unexpectedly, tightly correlated with optical variability, and thus their new method for optically identifying X-ray sources is demonstrated to be feasible. Given the large number of optical plates used, this method was most likely not more efficient than, for example, optical spectroscopy. However, it required no telescope time, only access to archival data.

The authors detected over 420 X-ray sources in the field and combined these data with deep near-IR, Spitzer/IRAC and Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX) mid-IR data. They find that about 360 of the X-ray sources have near-IR counterparts. They divide the region into five parts based on the X-ray point source characteristics and extended 8 micron emission. The most clearly defined regions are the central region, identified by embedded sources with high luminosities in the both the near-IR and X-ray as well as high X-ray temperatures (~3 keV), and the eastern region, identified by low extinction and ~1 keV X-ray temperatures. Other regions, identified by their directional relationship to RCW 108-IR, are less uniform, representing combinations of the first two regions, independent star formation epochs, or both. The cluster members range in X-ray luminosity from 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;29&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; to 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;33&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;.

The disk fraction becomes much higher when IRAC data are employed. The largest fraction of X-ray sources is best described as possessing some disk material via a more detailed extinction fitting.

A novel method, based on a component-separation procedure using a combination of Planck and IRAS data, has been validated and characterized on numerous simulations, and applied to select the most luminous cold sub-millimeter sources with spectral energy distributions peaking between 353 and 857GHz at 5-arcminute resolution. A total of 2,151 Planck high-z source candidates (the PHZ list) have been detected in the cleanest 26% of the sky, with flux density at 545 GHz above 500 mJy. Embedded in the cosmic infrared background close to the confusion limit, these high-z candidates exhibit colder colors than their surroundings, consistent with redshifts z greater than 2, assuming a dust temperature of T&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;xgal&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; = 35 K and a spectral index of beta&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;xgal&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; = 1.5. Exhibiting extremely high luminosities, larger than 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;14&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;sun&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;, the PHZ objects may be made of multiple galaxies or clumps at high redshift, as suggested by a first statistical analysis based on a comparison with number count models. Furthermore, first follow-up observations obtained from optical to sub-millimeter wavelengths, which can be found in companion papers, have confirmed that this list consists of two distinct populations. A small fraction (around 3%) of the sources have been identified as strongly gravitationally lensed star-forming galaxies at redshift 2 to 4, while the vast majority of the PHZ sources appear as overdensities of dusty star-forming galaxies, having colors consistent with being at z &amp;amp;gt; 2, and may be considered as proto-cluster candidates. The PHZ provides an original sample, which is complementary to the Planck Sunyaev-Zeldovich Catalog (PSZ2); by extending the population of virialized massive galaxy clusters detected below z &amp;amp;lt; 1.5 through their SZ signal to a population of sources at z &amp;amp;gt; 1.5, the PHZ may contain the progenitors of today&apos;s clusters. Hence the Planck list of high-redshift source candidates opens a new window on the study of the early stages of structure formation, particularly understanding the intensively star-forming phase at high-z. The compact source detection algorithm used herein requires positive detections simultaneously within a 5-arcminute radius in the 545-GHz excess map, and the 857-, 545-, and 353-GHz cleaned maps. It also requires a non-detection in the 100-GHz cleaned maps, which traces emission from synchrotron sources. A detection is then defined as a local maximum of the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) above a given threshold in each map, with a spatial separation of at least 5 arcminutes being required between two local maxima. A threshold of S/N &amp;amp;gt; 5 is adopted for detections in the 545-GHz excess map, while this is slightly relaxed to S/N &amp;amp;gt; 3 for detections in the cleaned maps because the constraint imposed by the spatial consistency between detections in all three bands is expected to reinforce the robustness of a simultaneous detection. Concerning the 100-GHz band, the authors adopt a similar threshold by requiring the absence of any local maximum with S/N &amp;amp;gt; 3 within a radius of 5 arcminutes.

The catalog (PSZ2) is the largest SZ-selected sample of galaxy clusters yet produced and the deepest systematic all-sky survey of galaxy clusters. It contains 1,653 detections, of which 1,203 are confirmed clusters with identified counterparts in external data sets, and is the first SZ-selected cluster survey containing more than 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;3&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; confirmed clusters. In the reference paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the survey selection function in terms of its completeness and statistical reliability, placing a lower limit of 83% on the purity. Using simulations, they find that the estimates of the SZ strength parameter Y&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;5R500&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; are robust to pressure-profile variation and beam systematics, but accurate conversion to Y&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;500&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; requires the use of prior information on the cluster extent. The authors also describe the multi-wavelength search for counterparts in ancillary data, which makes use of radio, microwave, infrared, optical, and X-ray data sets, and which places emphasis on the robustness of the counterpart match. They discuss the physical properties of the new sample and identify a population of low-redshift X-ray under-luminous clusters revealed by SZ selection. These objects appear in optical and SZ surveys with consistent properties for their mass, but they are almost absent from ROSAT X-ray selected samples. Three pipelines were used to detect SZ clusters: two independent implementations of the Matched Multi-Filter (MMF1 and MMF3) and PowellSnakes (PwS). The main catalog contained in this HEASARC table is constructed as the union of the catalogs from the three detection methods.

The Hitomi mission was launched on a JAXA H-IIA into low Earth orbit on February 17, 2016, at 5:45 pm JPS from Tanegashima Space Center. Hitomi was equipped with four different instruments that together cover a wide energy range 0.3-600 keV. The Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS), which combined a lightweight Soft X-ray Telescope paired with a X-ray Calorimeter Spectrometer, provided non-dispersive 7-eV resolution in the 0.3-10 keV bandpass with a field of view of about 3 arcminutes. The Soft X-ray Imager (SXI) expanded the field of view with a new generation CCD camera in the energy range of 0.5-12 keV at the focus of the second lightweights Soft X-ray Telescope; the Hard X-ray Imager (HXI, two units) performed sensitive imaging spectroscopy in the 5-80 keV band; the non-imaging Soft Gamma-ray Detector (SGD, two units) extended Hitomi&apos;s energy band to 600 keV. On March 27, 2016, JAXA lost contact with the satellite and, on April 28, announced the cessation of the efforts to restore mission operations. At that time Hitomi was in check-out phase and had started the calibration observations. Data were collected from six celestial objects (Perseus, N132D, IGR_J16318-4848, RXJ1856.5-3754, G21.5-0.9, and Crab) as well as black sky for a total of about one month of data. The data from these observations were divided into intervals of one day if the observation of a specific pointing was longer that one day. A sequence number was assigned to each observing day and within data from all instruments are included. The day division was mainly to limit the data size within a sequence number. There are in total 42 sequences, and each record in this database table is dedicated to a single sequence. The early observations do not contain data from all instruments and in cases the object was not always placed at the aim point. This database contains parameters to indicate which instrument was on and if the celestial source was in the field of view. The SXS was the first instrument to turn on and therefore all observations contain SXS data, although the thermal equilibrium was reached after March 4 2016.

The choice of this cut-off radius was based on a Monte Carlo simulation of about the same number of random positions that were used as input positions.

Combining the RASS Bright and Faint Source Catalogs yields an average of about three X-ray sources per square degree. However, while X-ray source counterparts are known to range from distant quasars to nearby M dwarfs, the RASS data alone are often insufficient to determine the nature of an X-ray source. As a result, large-scale follow-up programs are required to construct samples of known X-ray emitters. The authors use optical data produced by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to identify 709 stellar X-ray emitters cataloged in the RASS and falling within the SDSS Data Release 1 footprint. Most of these are bright stars with coronal X-ray emission unsuitable for SDSS spectroscopy, which is designed for fainter objects (g &amp;amp;gt; 15&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;mag&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;).

The radio luminosity function of optically selected QSOs and the extended radio emission associated with RLQs are both inconsistent with simple &amp;amp;quot;unified&amp;amp;quot; models that invoke relativistic beaming from randomly oriented QSOs to explain the difference between RLQs and RQQs. Some intrinsic property of the AGN or their host galaxies must also determine whether or not a QSO appears radio-loud.

The data are taken from a 12-hr observation made on 2013 April 13, with a frequency coverage from 75 to 175 MHz and an angular resolution of ~4 arcminutes. The catalog includes flux densities at eight sub-bands across the 21CMA bandwidth and provides the in-band spectral indices for the detected sources. To reduce the complexity of interferometric imaging from the so-called &amp;amp;quot;w&amp;amp;quot; term and ionospheric effects, the present analysis is restricted to the east-west baselines within 1500 m only. 624 radio sources are found within 5 degrees around the NCP down to ~0.1 Jy (100 mJy). These source counts are compared, and also exhibit a good agreement, with deep low-frequency observations made recently with the GMRT and MWA. In particular, for fainter radio sources below ~1 Jy, the authors find a flattening trend of source counts toward lower frequencies. While the thermal noise (~0.4 mJy) is well controlled to below the confusion limit, the dynamical range (~10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;4&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;) and sensitivity of current 21CMA imaging are largely limited by calibration and deconvolution errors, especially the grating lobes of very bright sources, such as 3C061.1, in the NCP field, which result from the regular spacings of the 21CMA. The authors note that particular attention should be paid to the extended sources, and their modeling and removal may constitute a large technical challenge for current EoR experiments. Their analysis may serve as a useful guide to the design of next generation low-frequency interferometers like the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). The 21CMA is a ground-based radio interferometer dedicated to the detection of the EoR. The array, sited in the Ulastai valley of western China, consists of 81 pods or stations, and a total of 10,287 log-periodic antennas are deployed in two perpendicular arms along the east-west (6.1 km) (see Figure 1 in the reference paper) and north-south (4 km) directions, respectively. The spacing of these 81 pods is chosen such that a sufficiently large number of redundant baselines and a good uniform UV coverage can both be guaranteed. Each antenna element has 16 pairs of dipoles with lengths varying from 0.242 to 0.829 m, optimized to cover a frequency range of 50-200 MHz, which gives rise to an angular resolution of 3 arcminutes at 200 MHz. All of the antennas are fixed on the ground and point at the NCP for the sake of simplicity and economy. In the current work, the radio point sources observed with the 40 pods of the 21 Centimeter Array (21CMA) E-W baselines in an integration of 12 hours made on 2013 April 13 centered on the North Celestial Pole (NCP) are presented. An extra deep sample with a higher sensitivity from a longer integration time of up to years will be published later. The authors have detected a total of 624 radio sources over the central field within 3 degrees in a frequency range of 75-175 MHz band and in the outer annulus from 3-5 degrees in the 75-125 MHz band. By performing a Monte-Carlo simulation, the authors estimate a completeness of 50% at a flux density of ~0.2 Jy.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=ncp21cma&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/ncp21cma.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The multi-epoch and ultra-wide-field (but relatively low-resolution) part of the survey was provided by 15 nights of observation using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) over a period of approximately a month, contemporaneous with K2 observations of this field. The multi-resolution aspect of the survey was provided by the low-resolution (4 arcminutes) MWA imaging, complemented by non-contemporaneous but much higher resolution (20 arcseconds) observations using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). The survey is, therefore, sensitive to the details of radio structures across a wide range of angular scales. Consistent with other recent low radio frequency surveys, no significant radio transients or variables were detected in the survey. The resulting source catalogs consist of 1,085 and 1,468 detections in the two MWA observation bands (centered at 154 and 185 MHz, respectively) and 7,445 detections in the GMRT observation band (centered at 148 MHz), over 314 square degrees. The survey is presented as a significant resource for multi-wavelength investigations of the more than 21,000 target objects in the K2 field. In the reference paper, the authors briefly examined their survey data against K2 target lists for dwarf star types (stellar types M and L) that had been known to produce radio flares. This survey included contemporaneous observations of the K2 Field 1 made with the MWA and historical (from 2010-2012) observations made with the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) GMRT Sky Survey (TGSS; see &amp;amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://tgss.ncra.tifr.res.in/&quot;&amp;amp;gt;http://tgss.ncra.tifr.res.in/&amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;gt;), via the TGSS Alternative Data Release 1 (ADR1; Intema et al. 2016, in prep.). The MWA and GMRT are radio telescopes operating at low radio frequencies (approximately 140-200 MHz for the work described here). The K2 mission Campaign 1 was conducted on Field 1 (center at J2000.0 coordinates RA of 11:35:45.51 and Dec of +01:25:02.28;), covering the North Galactic Cap, between 2014 May 30 and August 21. A full survey of the radio sky at 150 MHz as visible from the GMRT was performed within the scope of the PI-driven TGSS project between 2010 and early 2012, covering the declination range from -55 to +90 degrees. Summarizing the observational parameters as given on the TGSS project website (&amp;amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://tgss.ncra.tifr.res.in/150MHz/obsstrategy.html&quot;&amp;amp;gt;http://tgss.ncra.tifr.res.in/150MHz/obsstrategy.html&amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;gt;), the survey consists of more than 5,000 pointings on an approximate hexagonal grid. Data were recorded in full polarization (RR, LL, RL, LR) every 2 seconds, in 256 frequency channels across 16 MHz of bandwidth (140-156 MHz). Each pointing was observed for about 15 minutes, split over three or more scans spaced in time to improve UV-coverage. Typically, 20-40 pointings were grouped together into single night-time observing sessions, bracketed and interleaved by primary (flux density and bandpass) calibrator scans on 3C48, 3C147, and/or 3C286. Interleaving secondary (phase) calibrator scans on a variety of standard phase calibrators were also included, but were typically too faint to be of significant benefit at these frequencies. The single epoch TGSS image was processed in the same way as each of the MWA images using the background and noise characterization source finding techniques outlined in Section 3.1.3 of the reference paper. A source catalog was produced from the single TGSS image. For the high-resolution TGSS images, the sources were resolved in some cases and so morphology information is included in this catalog. The final set of MWA images after source finding yielded a total of 1,085 radio sources at 154 MHz, and 1,471 sources at 185 MHz over 314 square degrees, at an angular resolutions of ~4 arcminutes: this MWA catalog is contained in the HEASARC table &amp;amp;lt;a href=&quot;/W3Browse/radio-catalog/mwak2f1lfc.html&quot;&amp;amp;gt;MWAK2F1HFC&amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;gt;, which thus has 1,085 + 1,471 = 2,556 entries. The GMRT images, after source finding, yielded a total of 7,445 radio sources over the same field, at an angular resolution of ~0.3 arcminutes: this GMRT source catalog is contained in the present HEASARC table.

All observations were made in a standard MWA imaging mode with a 30.72-MHz bandwidth consisting of 24 contiguous 1.28-MHz &amp;amp;quot;coarse channels&amp;amp;quot;, each divided into 32 &amp;amp;quot;fine channels&amp;amp;quot; each of 40-kHz bandwidth (a total of 768 fine channels across 30.72 MHz). The temporal resolution of the MWA correlator output was set to 0.5s. All observations were made in full polarimetric mode, with all Stokes parameters formed from the orthogonal linearly polarized feeds. Observations were made at two center frequencies, 154.88 and 185.60 MHz, with two 296-s observations of the K2 field at each frequency on each night of observation, accompanied by observations of one of three calibrators (Centaurus A, Virgo A, or Hydra A) at each frequency, with 112-s observations. The observed fields were tracked, and thus, due to the fixed delay settings available to point the MWA primary beam, the tracked RA and Dec changes slightly between different observations (always a very small change compared to the MWA field of view). The total volume of MWA visibility data processed was approximately 2.2 TB. The synthesized beam at 154 MHz is approximately 4.6 x 4.2 arcminutes at a position angle of 105 degrees, and approximately 4 x 3 arcminutes at a position angle of 109 degrees at 185 MHz. The 154 MHz images have a typical noise of 100 mJy/beam, while the 184 MHz images have a typical noise of 70 mJy/beam. A source catalog was produced from each of the two frequencies of MWA data and given in Table 2 of the reference paper. The final set of MWA images after source finding yielded a total of 1,085 radio sources at 154 MHz, and 1,471 sources at 185 MHz over 314 square degrees, at an angular resolutions of ~4 arcminutes: this MWA catalog is contained in this HEASARC table, which thus has 1,085 + 1,471 = 2,556 entries.

The mosaic achieves a 1-sigma rms noise of 12 &amp;amp;micro;Jy at its most sensitive, and a homogeneous radio-selected catalog of over 2000 sources reaching flux densities as faint as 60 &amp;amp;micro;Jy has been compiled. The source parameter measurements are found to be consistent with the expected uncertainties from the image noise levels and the Gaussian source fitting procedure. A radio-selected sample avoids the complications of obscuration associated with optically selected samples, and by utilizing complementary PDS observations, including multicolor optical, near-infrared, and spectroscopic data, this radio catalog will be used in a detailed investigation of the evolution in star formation spanning the redshift range 0 &amp;amp;lt; z &amp;amp;lt; 1. The homogeneity of the catalog ensures a consistent picture of galaxy evolution can be developed over the full cosmologically significant redshift range of interest.

Near-infrared (K-band) data are also available for a selected sample of the radio sources, while spectroscopic observations have been carried out for about 40% of the optically identified sample. These provide redshifts and information on the stellar content. Emission-line ratios imply that most of the emission-line sources are star-forming galaxies, with a small contribution (~ 10%) from Seyfert 1/Seyfert 2 type objects. The authors also find a significant number of absorption-line systems, likely to be ellipticals. These dominate at high flux densities ( &amp;amp;gt; 1 mJy) but are also found at sub-mJy levels. Using the Balmer decrement, they find a visual extinction A&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;V&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; = 1.0 for the star-forming faint radio sources. This moderate reddening is consistent with the (V - R) and (R - K) colors of the optically identified sources. For emission-line galaxies, there is a correlation between the radio power and the H-alpha luminosity, in agreement with the result of Benn et al. (1993, MNRAS, 263, 98).

Of the X-ray sources, 47 have been detected in a new radio survey of M 83 obtained using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). Of the X-ray sources, at least 87 seem likely to be supernova remnants (SNRs), based on a combination of their properties in X-rays and at other wavelengths. The authors attempt to classify the point source population of M 83 through a combination of spectral and temporal analysis. As part of this effort, in the reference paper they carry out an initial spectral analysis of the 29 brightest X-ray sources. The soft X-ray sources in the disk, many of which are SNRs, are associated with the spiral arms, while the harder X-ray sources, mostly X-ray binaries (XRBs), do not appear to be.

Despite M 83&apos;s relatively high star formation rate, the CLF indicates that most of the XRBs in the disk are low mass X-ray binaries (XRBs). The X-ray observations of M 83 in this survey were all carried out with the ACIS-S in order to maximize the sensitivity to soft X-ray sources, such as SNRs, and to diffuse emission. The nucleus of M 83 was centered in the field of the back-illuminated S3 chip to provide reasonably uniform coverage of M 83. In addition to the S3 chip, data were also obtained from chips S1, S2, S4, I2, and I3. All of the observations were made in the &amp;amp;quot;very faint&amp;amp;quot; mode to optimize background subtraction. Observations were spaced over a period of one year from 2010 December to 2011 December, as indicated in Table 1 of the reference paper. The only difference among observations was the roll orientation of the spacecraft and the differing exposure times. All of the observations were nominal, and yielded a total of 729 ks of useful data. In order to maximize their sensitivity and more importantly to improve their ability to identify time variable sources, the authors included in their analysis earlier Chandra observations of M 83 in 2000 and 2001 totaling 61 ks which were obtained by G. Rieke (Prop ID. 1600489) and by A. Prestwich (Prop ID. 267005758). These data were obtained in a very similar manner to that of the present survey, and increased the total exposure to 790 ks. The authors used ACIS EXTRACT (AE) to derive net count rates from the sources in various energy bands: 0.35 - 8.0 keV (total or T), 0.35 - 1.1 keV (soft or S), 1.1 - 2.6 keV (medium or M), 2.6 - 8.0 keV (hard or H), 0.5 - 2.0 keV (&amp;amp;quot;normal&amp;amp;quot; soft band) and 2.0 - 8.0 keV (&amp;amp;quot;normal&amp;amp;quot; hard band). Their choice of these bands was based on a variety of overlapping goals. The broad 0.35 - 8.0 keV band samples the full energy range accessible to Chandra observations. The three bands S, M and H provide energy ranges intended to classify sources on the basis of their hardness ratios. The boundary at 1.1 keV, in particular, is just above the region containing strong features due to Ne and Fe seen in the spectra of most SNRs. The 0.5 - 2.0 keV and 2.0 - 8.0 keV bands are needed because number counts of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and of X-ray binary populations are normally carried out in these bands and because the 0.5 - 2.0 keV band, encompassing the peak of the response curve, provides better statistics for some purposes than S+M. The AE count rates were used to establish which of the sources in the candidate list were statistically valid. The authors retained any source that had a probability-of-no-source &amp;amp;lt; 5 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-6&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; in any one of these bands in the total data set. For their final run of AE, their list of source candidates had 847 potential sources. Of those, they find a total of 458 valid point sources, whose properties are listed in this table. Of the 458 point sources, 378 are located within the area defined by the D&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;25&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ellipse of the galaxy (which the authors take to have a major axis diameter of 12.9 arcminutes), and the remaining 80 are outside this region. There were 43 sources in the nuclear region (defined to be any source within a projected radius of 0.5 kpc from the optical nucleus).</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=m83cxo&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/m83cxo.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

For the sources with 2MASS counterparts, the values of their magnitudes in the J, H and K bands are also given. Additionally, for the sources with a Chandra counterpart (within a search radius of 5 arcsec), the values of their Chandra source number (as given in the related Browse table NGC752CXO) are also given. Very little is known about the evolution of stellar activity between the ages of the Hyades (0.8 Gyr) and the Sun (4.6 Gyr). To gain information on the typical level of coronal activity at a star&apos;s intermediate age, the authors have studied the X-ray emission from stars in the 1.9 Gyr-old open cluster NGC 752. They analyzed a ~ 140 ks Chandra observation of NGC 752 and a ~50 ks XMM-Newton observation of the same cluster. They detected 262 X-ray sources in the Chandra data and 145 sources in the XMM-Newton observation. Around 90% of the catalogued cluster members within Chandra&apos;s field of view are detected in the X-ray observation. The X-ray luminosity of all observed cluster members (28 stars) and of 11 cluster member candidates was derived. These data indicate that, at an age of 1.9 Gyr, the typical X-ray luminosity L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;x&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; of the cluster members with masses of 0.8 to 1.2 solar masses is 1.3 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;28&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, which is approximately a factor of 6 times less intense than that observed in the younger Hyades. Given that L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;x&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; is proportional to the square of a star&apos;s rotational rate, the median L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;x&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; of NGC 752 is consistent, for t &amp;amp;gt;= 1 Gyr, with a decaying rate in rotational velocities v&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;rot&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ t&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-alpha&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; with alpha ~ 0.75, steeper than the Skumanich relation (alpha ~ 0.5) and significantly steeper than that observed between the Pleiades and the Hyades (where alpha &amp;amp;lt;0.3), suggesting that a change in the rotational regimes of the stellar interiors is taking place at an age of ~ 1 Gyr. NGC 752 was observed for 49 ks by the XMM-Newton EPIC camera on February 5, 2003 starting at 23:29:25 UT, and the nominal pointing was towards J2000.0 RA and Declination of (01:57:38, +37:47:60), thus the XMM-Newton field-of-view (FOV) includes the Chandra FOV. For the source detection, the authors used the PWXDETECT code developed at Palermo Observatory and derived from the analogous Chandra PWDETECT code based on wavelet transform analysis. This allows the three EPIC exposures (PN, MOS1 and MOS2) to be combined in order to gain a deeper sensitivity with respect to the source detection based on single images. There were 145 point sources detected in the energy band 0.5 - 2.0 keV. An extended source (not listed in this present table), very likely a galaxy cluster, is also visible in the EPIC data. The authors searched for 2MASS counterparts to the XMM-Newton sources using a search radius of 5 arcsec and found a counterpart for 38 sources. As for the Chandra data, all sources with a visible counterpart from DLM94 have also a 2MASS counterpart, so this leaves 15 XMM-Newton sources with a 2MASS counterpart and no counterpart in Daniel et al. (1994, PASP, 106, 281); of these, 3 were also detected by Chandra; of the other 12, 10 are outside the Chandra FOV, while two are within it (XMM-Newton sources 58 and 65). Source 65 was caught by XMM-Newton during the decay phase of a flare, which explains why it is not detected in the Chandra data. For source 58 there is no immediate explanation for this, since the light curve does not show evidence of a flare. No additional near-IR counterpart to the XMM-Newton sources was found within the Point Source Reject Table of the 2MASS Extended Mission.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=ngc752xmm&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/ngc752xmm.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The FIRST survey began in 1993, and covers the north and south Galactic caps. The present 14Dec17 version is derived from the 1993 through 2011 observations. The catalog covers a total of about 10,575 square degrees of sky (8,444 square degrees in the north Galactic cap and 2,131 square degrees in the south Galactic cap). See the coverage maps at &amp;amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://sundog.stsci.edu/first/catalogs/readme_14dec17.html#coverage&quot;&amp;amp;gt;http://sundog.stsci.edu/first/catalogs/readme_14dec17.html#coverage&amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;gt; for more details of the area covered. Both the northern and southern areas were chosen to coincide approximately with the area covered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The catalog is identical to the previous version of the catalog (14Mar04) except that it has more accurate data on which sources are not covered by the SDSS DR10 catalog. Approximately 1000 sources that were indicated as covered by DR10 in the previous version are now correctly marked as not covered. The source list, radio fluxes, etc., are all the same as the 14Mar04 version. In this version of the catalog, images taken in the the new EVLA configuration have been re-reduced using shallower CLEAN thresholds in order to reduce the &amp;amp;quot;CLEAN bias&amp;amp;quot; in those images. Also, the EVLA images are not co-added with older VLA images to avoid problems resulting from the different frequencies and noise properties of the configurations. That leads to small gaps in the sky coverage at boundaries between the EVLA and VLA regions. As a result, the area covered by this release of the catalog is about 60 square degrees smaller than the earlier release of the catalog (13Jun05), and the total number of sources is reduced by nearly 25,000. The previous version of the catalog does have sources in the overlap regions, but their flux densities are considered unreliable due to calibration errors. The flux densities should be more accurate in this catalog, biases are smaller, and the incidence of spurious sources is also reduced. Over most of the survey area, the detection limit is 1 mJy. A region along the equatorial strip (RA = 21.3 to 3.3 hrs, Dec = -1 to 1 deg) has a deeper detection threshold because two epochs of observation were combined. The typical detection threshold in this region is 0.75 mJy. There are approximately 4,500 sources below the 1 mJy threshold used for most previous versions of the catalog. The format of this catalog is the same as releases since 13Jun05 but differs from earlier versions of the catalog. It contains two parameters which give information on the epoch of observation for each source (called mean_epoch and rms_epoch in this HEASARC version) which are described below. The P(S) parameter (called sidelobe_prob herein), which indicates the probability that the source is a sidelobe, replaces the previous binary sidelobe flag column. The parameters sdss_matches, sdss_first_offset, sdss_imag, sdss_class, twomass_matches, twomass_first_offset and twomass_kmag give information on counterparts to the FIRST source in the SDSS DR10 catalog and the 2MASS catalog, respectively. Other catalog parameters are common with FIRST catalog releases extending back over the past decade. The co-added images are available online: see the FIRST page at &amp;amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://sundog.stsci.edu/first/images.html&quot;&amp;amp;gt;http://sundog.stsci.edu/first/images.html&amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;gt; for details. The source catalog presented here is derived from the images. Data for the FIRST survey were collected in all VLA B-configurations from Spring 1993 through Spring 2004. For all data collected for the FIRST project, the raw u-v visibility data are placed in the VLA public archive on the day they are taken, and are available for use without restriction. Additional data in the southern Galactic cap were acquired in Spring 2009 and Spring 2011. The VLA was in a hybrid condition in 2009, with some new EVLA receivers and some old VLA receivers. The characteristics of those images are slightly different from the older data, but for most purposes they should be equivalent. In 2011 the EVLA receivers were available with an early version of the new EVLA data system, so there are a number of differences from the old data: &amp;amp;lt;pre&amp;amp;gt; Date Frequencies Bandpass Integration Before 2011 1365, 1435 MHz 2x7 3-MHz channels 180 seconds 2011 1335, 1730 MHz 2x64 2-MHz channels 60 seconds &amp;amp;lt;/pre&amp;amp;gt; Note particularly the frequency difference between the new and older data. The new data are in co-added fields with names ending with &apos;S&apos; (and later letters in the alphabet) and are found entirely in the south Galactic cap.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=first&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/first.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The survey covers 783 square degrees of high galactic latitude sky and includes 210 serendipitous sources which define a complete (flux-limited) sample. An extensive program of optical and radio observatories together with cross-correlations with catalogs of known objects lead to the identification of 200 of the 210 detected sources. The 10 remaining objects have been preliminarily classified on the basis of their X-ray to optical flux ratios, thus making the sample essentially fully identified. Twenty-three additional serendipitous sources which did not satisfy the requirements for inclusion in the complete sample were also identified during the optical observations program. The complete sample has been used to study the logN-logS relation and the average spectral slope of AGN. It is found that the logN-logS slope is consistent with that of the Einstein Extended Medium Sensitivity Survey (EMSS) and with the &amp;amp;quot;Euclidean&amp;amp;quot; value of 1.5. The normalization of the logN-logS is a strong function of the assumed spectral slope of AGN. Consistency with the results of the EMSS implies that the average (energy) slope of extragalactic sources in the soft X-ray band is very steep (alpha ~ 1.5). An analysis of the association between AGN detection and Galactic NH also shows that alpha is steep and inconsistent with the canonical value of 0.7. The survey was particularly successful in detecting nearby Galactic soft X-ray emitters and includes a significantly higher percentage of stars than the Einstein EMSS, five White Dwarfs, and three previously unknown AM Her type systems.

In the reference paper, the authors review and characterize all of the associations as published in the 1FGL and 2FGL catalogs on the basis of multi-frequency archival observations. In particular, they locate 177 spectra for the low-energy counterparts that were not listed in the previous Fermi catalogs, and in addition they present new spectroscopic observations of eight gamma-ray blazar candidates. Based on their investigations, the authors introduce a new counterpart category of &amp;amp;quot;candidate associations&amp;amp;quot; and propose a refined classification for the candidate low-energy counterparts of the Fermi sources. They compare the 1FGL-assigned counterparts with those listed in 2FGL to determine which unassociated sources became associated in later releases of the Fermi catalogs. The authors also search for potential counterparts to all of the remaining unassociated Fermi sources. Finally, they prepare a refined and merged list of all of the associations of 1FGL plus 2FGL that includes 2219 unique Fermi objects.

In this work, the authors also report that, at energies above 10 GeV, unresolved sources account for 27% +/- 8% of the isotropic gamma-ray background, while the unresolved Galactic population contributes only at the few percent level to the Galactic diffuse background. The authors also highlight the subset of the 1FHL sources that are the best candidates for detection at energies above 50 - 100 GeV with current and future ground-based gamma-ray observatories. The time interval analyzed here is from the beginning of Fermi LAT science operations on 2008 August 4 (MET 239557447) to 2011 August 1 (MET 333849586), covering very nearly 3 years. In this work, the authors analyze gamma rays with energies in the range 10-500 GeV. To limit the contamination from gamma rays produced by cosmic-ray interactions in the upper atmosphere, gamma rays with zenith angles greater than 105 degrees were excluded. To further reduce the residual gamma rays from the upper atmosphere only data for time periods when the spacecraft rocking angle was less than 52 degrees were considered.

The authors measure the &amp;amp;quot;excess&amp;amp;quot; X-ray luminosity of RIQs and RLQs relative to radio-quiet quasars (RQQs) as a function of radio loudness and luminosity, and parametrize the X-ray luminosity of RIQs and RLQs both as a function of optical/UV luminosity and also as a joint function of optical/UV and radio luminosity. RIQs are only modestly X-ray bright relative to RQQs; it is only at high values of radio loudness (R&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;L&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt;~ 3.5) and radio luminosity that RLQs become strongly X-ray bright.

The primary sample contained herein consists of 654 optically selected RIQs and RLQs with SDSS/FIRST observations and high-quality X-ray coverage from Chandra (171), XMM-Newton (202), or ROSAT (281). The primary sample is split nearly evenly between spectroscopic (312) and high-confidence photometric (342) quasars. Most (562) of the primary sample objects possess serendipitous off-axis X-ray coverage, while the remainder (92) were targeted in the observations used in this sample. The X-ray detection fraction for the primary sample is 84%; the detection fraction for those objects with Chandra/XMM-Newton/ROSAT coverage is 95%/92%/70% (typical ROSAT observations are comparatively less sensitive and have higher background).

With a significant sample of AGNs (N = 27) at z &amp;amp;gt; 4, it is found that both source number counts in the 0.5-2 keV band and comoving space density are consistent with the expectation of a luminosity-dependent density evolution (LDDE) model at all redshifts, while they exclude the luminosity and density evolution (LADE) model. The measured comoving space density of type-1 and type-2 AGNs shows a constant ratio between the two types at z &amp;amp;gt; 3.

For the first time, they compute number counts for obscured (HR &amp;amp;gt; -0.2) and unobscured (HR &amp;amp;lt; -0.2) sources and find significant differences between the two populations in the soft band. Due to the unprecedented large exposure, the COSMOS-Legacy area is three times larger than surveys at similar depths and its depth is three times fainter than surveys covering similar areas. The area-flux region occupied by COSMOS-Legacy is likely to remain unsurpassed for years to come. The half-a-field shift tiling strategy was designed to uniformly cover the COSMOS Hubble area in depth and point-spread function (PSF) size by combining the old C-COSMOS (Elvis et al., 2009, ApJS, 184, 158) observations with the new Chandra ones (see Figure 1 in the reference paper). The main properties of the new ACIS-I Chandra COSMOS-Legacy observations are summarized in Table 1 therein.

The catalog includes sources with redshift &amp;amp;lt;=0.15, an edge-brightened radio morphology, and those with at least one of the emission peaks located at a radius r larger than 30 kpc from the center of the host. The radio luminosity at 1.4 GHz of the FRIICAT sources covers the range L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;1.4&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;39.5&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; - 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;42.5&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg/s. The FRIICAT catalog has 90% of low- and 10% of high-excitation galaxies (LEGs and HEGs), respectively. The properties of these two classes are significantly different. The FRIICAT LEGs are mostly luminous (-20 &amp;amp;gt;~ M&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;r&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt;~ -24), red early-type galaxies with black hole masses in the range 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;8&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; M&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;sun&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;~ M&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;BH&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;~ 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;9&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; M_sun_; they are essentially indistinguishable from the FR Is belonging to the FRICAT sample (Capetti et al. 2017, A&amp;amp;amp;A, 598, A49: also available as a HEASARC table). The HEG FR IIs are associated with optically bluer and mid-IR redder hosts than the LEG FR IIs and to galaxies and black holes that are smaller, on average, by a factor of ~2. FR IIs have a factor of ~3 higher average radio luminosity than FR Is. Nonetheless, most (~90%) of the selected FR IIs have a radio power that is lower, by as much as a factor of ~100, than the transition value between FR Is and FR IIs found in the 3C sample. The correspondence between the morphological classification of FR I and FR II and the separation in radio power disappears when including sources selected at low radio flux thresholds, which is in line with previous results. In conclusion, a radio source produced by a low-power jet can be edge brightened or edge darkened, and the outcome is not related to differences in the optical properties of the host galaxy. The authors searched for FR II radio galaxies in the sample of 18,286 radio sources built by Best &amp;amp;amp; Heckman (2012, MNRAS, 421, 1569) by limiting their search to the subsample of objects in which, according to these latter authors, the radio emission is produced by an active nucleus. They cross-matched the optical spectroscopic catalogs produced by the group from the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics and Johns Hopkins University (Brinchmann et al. 2004, MNRAS, 351, 1151; Tremonti et al. 2004, ApJ, 613, 898) based on data from the Data Release 7 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (DR7/SDSS; Abazajian et al. 2009, ApJS, 182, 543) with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory Very Large Array Sky Survey (NVSS; Condon et al. 1998, AJ, 115, 1693, CDS Cat.

The majority (108) of the selected FR IIs are classified as LEG, but there are also 14 HEG and just one source that cannot be classified spectroscopically because of the lack of emission lines, namely SDSS J144625.13+214209.8.

The AT20G source positions are accurate to within ~1 arcsec and, after excluding known Galactic sources, 43% of Fermi 1FGL sources have an AT20G source within the 95% Fermi confidence ellipse. Monte Carlo tests imply that at least 95% of these matches are genuine associations. Only five gamma-ray sources (1% of the Fermi catalog) have more than one AT20G counterpart in the Fermi error box. The AT20G matches also generally support the active galactic nucleus (AGN) associations in the First LAT AGN Catalog. The authors find a trend of increasing gamma-ray flux density with 20 GHz radio flux density. The Fermi detection rate of AT20G sources is close to 100% for the brightest 20 GHz sources, decreasing to 20% at 1 Jy, and to roughly 1% at 100 mJy. Eight of the matched AT20G sources have no association listed in 1FGL and are presented here as potential gamma-ray AGNs for the first time. The authors also identify an alternative AGN counterpart to one 1FGL source. The percentage of Fermi sources with AT20G detections decreases toward the Galactic plane, suggesting that the 1FGL catalog contains at least 50 Galactic gamma-ray sources in the southern hemisphere that are yet to be identified.

The AT20G source catalogue presented here is an order of magnitude larger than any previous catalogue of high-frequency radio sources, and includes 5890 sources above a 20-GHz flux-density limit of 40 mJy. All AT20G sources have total intensity and polarisation measured at 20 GHz, and most sources south of declination -15 degrees also have near-simultaneous flux-density measurements at 5 and 8 GHz. A total of 1559 sources were detected in polarised total intensity at one or more of the three frequencies. The completeness of the AT20G source catalog is 91% above 100 mJy/beam and 79% above 50 mJy/beam in regions south of Declination -15 degrees. North of -15 degrees, some observations of sources between 14 and 20 hours in RA were lost due to bad weather and could not be repeated, so the catalog completeness is lower in this region.

The authors present the results of 60 months of observation from 2005 March to 2010 March of the hard X-ray sky with the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT). In this time frame, BAT detected (in the 15 - 55 keV band) 720 sources with a signal-to-noise ratio of &amp;amp;gt;= 5 sigma in an all-sky survey, of which 428 are associated with AGNs, most of which are nearby. This sample has negligible incompleteness and statistics which are a factor of ~ 2 larger over similarly complete sets of AGNs. The sample contains (at least) 15 bona fide Compton-thick AGNs and 3 likely candidates. Compton-thick AGNs represent ~ 5% of AGN samples detected above 15 keV. The authors use the BAT data set to refine the determination of the log N - log S of AGNs which is extremely important, now that NuSTAR prepares for launch, toward assessing the AGN contribution to the cosmic X-ray background. The authors show that the log N - log S of AGNs selected above 10 keV is now established to ~ 10% precision. They derive the luminosity function of Compton-thick AGNs and measure a space density of 7.9 (+4.1, -2.9) x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-5&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; Mpc&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-3&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; for objects with a de-absorbed luminosity larger than 2 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;42&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;.

The XMM-Newton survey in the Chandra Deep Field South (XMM-CDFS) aims at detecting and studying the spectral properties of a significant number of obscured and Compton-thick (N&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;H&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt;= 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;24&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;) AGN. The large effective area of XMM-Newton in the 2-10 and 5-10 keV bands, coupled with a 3.45-Ms nominal exposure time (2.82 and 2.45 Ms after lightcurve cleaning for MOS and PN respectively), allows the authors to build clean samples in both bands, and makes the XMM-CDFS the deepest XMM-Newton survey currently published in the 5-10 keV band. The large multi-wavelength and spectroscopic coverage of the CDFS area allows for an immediate and abundant scientific return. In this paper, the authors present the data reduction of the XMM-CDFS observations, the method for source detection in the 2-10 and 5-10 keV bands, and the resulting catalogs. A number of 339 and 137 sources are listed in the above bands with flux limits of 6.6 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-16&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; and 9.5 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-16&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg/s/cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, respectively. The flux limits at 50% of the maximum sky coverage are 1.8 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-15&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; and 4.0 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-15&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg/s/cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, respectively. The catalogs have been cross-correlated with the Chandra ones: 315 and 130 identifications have been found with a likelihood-ratio method, respectively. 15 new sources, previously undetected by Chandra, have been found; 5 of them lie in the 4-Ms area. Redshifts, either spectroscopic or photometric, are available for ~92% of the sources. The number counts in both bands are presented and compared to other works. The survey coverage has been calculated with the help of two extensive sets of simulations, one set per band. The simulations have been produced with a newly-developed simulator, written with the aim of the most careful reproduction of the background spatial properties. For this reason, the authors present a detailed decomposition of the XMM-Newton background into its components: cosmic, particle, and residual soft protons. The three components have different spatial distributions. The importance of these three components depends on the band and on the camera; the particle background is the most important one (80-90% of the background counts), followed by the soft protons (4-20%). X-ray sources were detected in the 3-Ms XMM-Newton observations of the Chandra Deep Field South. Source detection was done in two steps, first using the PWXDetect software, and then using emldetect. 339 Sources detected by both programs are presented in the main tables, while 74 sources only detected by PWXDetect are presented in the supplementary tables. The 2-10 and 5-10 keV bands were analyzed separately. This HEASARC table contains the main sample of 339 sources detected in the 2-10 keV band in the XMM-CDFS survey. (The table of 5-10 keV XMM-CDFS sources is also available at the HEASARC as the XMMCDFS510 table). This table does not include the 74 supplementary sources which were detected only with PWXDetect. These supplementary sources were on average detected at low significance; many of them were on the borders of the FOV; and a few were in crowded fields where EMLDetect had trouble separating the different PSF components. Nevertheless, 4 of these sources were bright enough that a spectrum could be extracted.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=xmmcdfs210&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/xmmcdfs210.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

This catalog contains two types of spectra extracted from 2,145 GRBs, and fitted with five different spectral models resulting in a compendium of over 19,000 spectra. The models were selected based on their empirical importance to the spectral shape of many GRBs, and the analysis performed was devised to be as thorough and objective as possible. In their paper, the authors describe in detail their procedures and criteria for the analyses, and present the bulk results in the form of parameter distributions. This catalog should be considered an official product from the BATSE Science Team, and the data files containing the complete results are soon to be available from the HEASARC. This table lists all of the spectroscopy results of gamma-ray bursts observed by a subset of the 8 BATSE Large Area Detectors. BATSE consisted, in part, of an array of 8 sodium iodide Large Area Detectors (LADs) which covered the energy range from ~20 keV - 2 MeV. The LAD detectors were placed at each of the eight corners of the CGRO spacecraft with an outward orientation such that the entire sky not occulted by the Eartt was observed. The spectrum files (&amp;amp;quot;scat&amp;amp;quot; files) available as FITS-format data products associated with this catalog provide parameter values and goodness-of-fit measures for different types of spectral fits and models. These fits are performed using 14-channel data, usually 2-second resolution CONT data. There are currently two spectrum categories: &amp;amp;lt;pre&amp;amp;gt; * Peak flux (&apos;pflx&apos;) - a single spectrum over a 2.05-second time range at the peak flux of the burst * Fluence (&apos;flnc&apos;) - a single spectrum over the entire burst duration &amp;amp;lt;/pre&amp;amp;gt; The quoted fluxes and fluences are for the 20 keV - 2 MeV energy range, notice. The scat files have two extensions. The first extension gives detector-specific information, including photon fluxes and fluences for each detector, which are provided for each energy channel. The second extension provides derived quantities such as flux, fluence and model parameters for the joint fit of all included detectors. The scat files and their energy-resolved quantities contained in these two extensions will be available soon in the HEASARC data archive. Quantities derived from these spectral fits are available in the present table, as described below and in the Goldstein et al. (2013) reference paper. The spectra are fit with a number of models, with the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum often determining whether a more complex model is statistically favored. The current set is: &amp;amp;lt;pre&amp;amp;gt; * Power law (&apos;plaw&apos;), * Comptonized (exponentially attenuated power law; &apos;comp&apos;) * Band (&apos;band&apos;) * Smoothly broken power law (&apos;sbpl&apos;) * Log_10 Gaussian (&apos;glog&apos;) &amp;amp;lt;/pre&amp;amp;gt; The full details of these models are presented in Section 4 of the reference paper. The type of spectrum and spectral model are coded into the parameter names (and the associated file names) using the acronyms given above. Thus for example, the parameters with names beginning with &apos;flnc_glog&apos; contain the results from fits to the fluence spectra using Log&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;10&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; Gaussian models. The corresponding spectrum file for the burst with trigger number 105 with the results from a fit to the fluence spectrum using a Log&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;10&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; Gaussian model is named scat_0105_flnc_glog_v00.fit. Please note that this table lists the raw results of each spectral fit to each GRB. In cases where the spectral fit failed, the values reported are those that initialized the spectral fit. If the uncertainty on the spectral parameters is reported as zero (no uncertainty), then the fit failed. In a few cases throughout this table, the uncertainties for certain spectral parameters may be reported as &apos;9999.99&apos; which indicates that the uncertainty on that parameter is completely unconstrained. An example of this is when the spectral data from a burst is fitted with a BAND function but is unable to constrain the high-energy index. In this case, the best fit centroid value of the high-energy index parameter is reported, and the &apos;9999.99&apos; value is reported for the uncertainty.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=bat5bgrbsp&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/bat5bgrbsp.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

They allow us to identify young stars even after they have lost the IR signatures of circumstellar disks and provide constraints on their distance. Here, the authors report on XMM-Newton observations that detected 121 young stellar objects (YSOs) in two fields between the filamentary dark cloud complex Lynds 1641S and the star Kappa Ori. These observations extend the Survey of Orion A with XMM and Spitzer (SOXS). The YSOs are contained in a ring of gas and dust apparent at millimeter wavelengths, and in far-IR and near-IR surveys. The X-ray luminosity function of the YSOs detected in the two fields indicates a distance of 250-280 pc, much closer than the Orion A cloud and similar to the distance estimates for Kappa Ori. The authors propose that the ring is a 5-8 pc diameter shell that has been swept up by Kappa Ori. This ring contains several groups of stars detected by Spitzer and WISE including one surrounding the Herbig Ae/Be star V1818 Ori. In this interpretation, the Kappa Ori ring is one of several shells swept up by massive stars within the Orion Eridanus Superbubble and is unrelated to the southern portion of Orion A/L 1641S. The XMM-Newton observations consist of two fields, north (Field N = KN) and south (Field S = KS), and were obtained in 2015 March 10 and 15 using EPIC as the primary instrument. Table 1 in the reference paper shows the details of the exposures, each one with a duration of about 50 ks and taken with the Medium filter. The authors used SAS version 14.0 to reduce the observation data files (ODFs) and to obtain calibrated lists of events for the MOS and pn instruments. They filtered the events in the 0.3-0.8 keV energy band and used only events with FLAG = 0 and PATTERN &amp;amp;lt; 12 as prescribed by the SAS manual. With SAS, the authors obtained exposure maps in the 0.3-8.0 keV band and performed source detection with a code based on wavelet convolution that operated simultaneously on MOS and pn data. They used a threshold of significance of 4.5 sigma of the local background to discriminate real sources from spurious background fluctuations. However, they added few sources to the final list with significance S in 4.0 &amp;amp;lt; S &amp;amp;lt; 4.5 for the cases of positional match with objects in SIMBAD or PPMX catalogs. The final list was also checked for spurious sources that could appear at the border of the CCDs. In sum, the authors detected 238 X-ray sources with significance &amp;amp;gt; 4 sigma of the local background; 104 sources are in KN and 134 in KS. The authors cross-correlated the positions of the X-ray sources with the coordinates of the IR catalog of Megeath et al. (2012, AJ, 144, 192). This IR catalog is the result of a survey of Orion with Spitzer that produced a classification of protostars and stars with disks. Of the 238 X-ray sources, 191 are identified within 8 arcseconds of one of 206 IR objects, 99 sources in KS, 92 sources in KN. Some X-ray sources were multiple matches within 8 arcsec of IR objects. For these cases, the authors assigned the most likely counterparts based on IR photometry and visual inspection of X-rays and IR images. However, nine X-ray sources were left associated with two or three IR objects. Among the IR matches, the authors found 15 stars with disks in KN and 35 in KS with X-ray detection. One protostar in KN and three in KS were detected in X-rays. The authors used X-ray detection of sources without IR excess as criteria to identify disk-less stars (hereafter Class III stars). They classified as Class III stars those IR objects with X-ray detections, with [4.5um]-[8.0um] colors &amp;amp;lt; 0.3 mag and brighter than [4.5um] magnitude &amp;amp;lt; 14. At the distance of the ONC (400 pc), the [4.5um] magnitude ~ 14 threshold at an age of 4-5 Myrs roughly identifies M3-M4 spectral types and masses around 0.3 solar masses. With this selection scheme, the authors identified 48 objects in KN and 19 in KS as Class III candidates.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=kaporixmm&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/kaporixmm.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

They present a sample of 21 X-ray sources that are variable between observations at the 3-sigma level, from a catalog of 110 unique point sources (the HEASARC notes that there are actually 111 sources in the CDS version of the catalog from which this HEASARC table originates). The authors find four transients (flux variability ratio greater than 10) and a further eight objects with ratios &amp;amp;gt;5. The observations span the years 2003-2010 and reach a limiting luminosity of &amp;amp;gt;10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;35&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg/s, providing sensitivity to X-ray binaries in IC 10 as well as flare stars in the foreground Milky Way. The nature of the variable sources is investigated from light curves, X-ray spectra, energy quantiles, and optical counterparts. The purpose of this study is to discover the composition of the X-ray binary population in a young starburst environment. IC 10 provides a sharp contrast in stellar population age (&amp;amp;lt;10 million years) when compared to the Magellanic Clouds (40-200 Myr) where most of the known HMXBs reside. The authors find 10 strong HMXB candidates, 2 probable background active galactic nuclei, 4 foreground flare-stars or active binaries, and 5 not yet classifiable sources. Complete classification of the sample requires optical spectroscopy for radial velocity analysis and deeper X-ray observations to obtain higher S/N spectra and search for pulsations.

Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) at frequencies of 4.5 GHz and 7.5 GHz. A total of 610 sources were detected, 59 of which are related to young stellar objects (YSOs) and 18 to field stars. The properties of 56% of the young stars are compatible with non-thermal radio emission. The authors also show that the radio emission of more evolved YSOs tends to be more non-thermal in origin and, in general, that their radio properties are compatible with those found in other star-forming regions. By comparing their results with previously reported X-ray observations, the authors noticed that YSOs in Taurus-Auriga follow a Guedel-Benz relation with a scaling factor, kappa, of 0.03, as they previously suggested for other regions of star formation. In general, YSOs in Taurus-Auriga and in all the previous studied regions seem to follow this relation with a dispersion of ~1 dex. Finally, the authors propose that most of the remaining sources are related with extragalactic objects but provide a list of 46 unidentified radio sources whose radio properties are compatible with a YSO nature (identified in this implementation of their catalog by values for the parameter radio_yso_flag of &apos;Y&apos;). The observations were obtained with the JVLA of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) in its B and BnA configuration. Two frequency sub-bands, each 1 GHz wide, and centered at 4.5 and 7.5 GHz, respectively, were recorded simultaneously. The observations were obtained in three different time periods (February 25/26/28 to March 6, April 12/17/20/25, and April 30 to May 1/5/14/22, all in 2011) typically separated from one another by a month: see Table 1 of the reference paper for more details. For their study, the authors observed 127 different target fields distributed across the cloud complex (Figure 1 of the reference paper). The fields were chosen to cover previously known YSOs. In 33 of those fields, the authors could observe more than one YSO target, while in the remaining 94 fields, only one YSO was targeted. In most cases, the infrared evolutionary class (i.e., Classes I, II, or III) or T Tauri evolutionary status (classical or weak line) of the targeted sources was known from the literature. The final images covered circular areas of 8.8 and 14.3 arcminutes in diameter, for the 7.5 and 4.5 GHz sub-bands, respectively, and were corrected for the effects of the position-dependent primary beam response. The noise levels reached for each individual observation was about ~40 microJy and ~30 microJy, at 4.5 GHz and7.5 GHz, respectively. The visibilities of the three, or two, observations obtained for each field were concatenated to produce a new image with a lower noise level (of about ~25 microJy at 4.5 GHz and ~18 microJy at 7.5 GHz). The angular resolution of ~1 arcsecond (see the synthesized beam sizes in Table 1 of the reference paper) allows an uncertainty in position of ~0.1 arcseconds or better. In the observed area, there are a total of 196 known YSOs.The first step was the identification of radio sources in the observed fields. The authors follow the procedure and criteria presented by Dzib et al. (2013, ApJ, 775, 63) who consider a detection as firm if the sources have a flux larger than 4 times the noise level and there is a counterpart known at another wavelength, else they require a flux which is 5 times the noise level. The identification was done using the images corresponding to the concatenation of the observed epochs, which provides the highest sensitivity. From this, a total of 609 sources were detected. Of these sources, 215 were only detected in the 4.5 GHz sub-band, while six were only detected in the 7.5 GHz sub-band. The remaining 388 sources were detected in both sub-bands. The authors searched the literature for previous radio detections, and for counterparts at X-ray, optical, near-infrared, and mid-infrared wavelengths. The search was done using SIMBAD, and accessed all the major catalogs. They considered a radio source to be associated with a counterpart at another wavelength if the separation between the two was below the combined uncertainties of the two data sets. This was about 1.0 arcsecond for the optical and infrared catalogs, but could be significantly larger for some of the radio catalogs (for instance, the NVSS has a positional uncertainty of about 5 arcseconds). They found that only 120 of the sources detected here had previously been reported at radio wavelengths, while the other 491 are new radio detections. On the other hand, the authors found a total of 270 counterparts at other wavelengths.

The EPIC images of this region reveal a cluster of point sources, most of which have optical counterparts inside the very young open cluster NGC 6530. The bulk of these X-ray sources are probably associated with low and intermediate mass pre-main sequence stars. One of the sources experienced a flare-like increase of its X-ray flux making it the second brightest source in M 8 after the O4 star 9 Sgr. The X-ray spectra of most of the brightest sources can be fitted with thermal plasma models with temperatures of kT ~ a few keV. Only a few of the X-ray selected PMS candidates are known to display H-alpha emission and were previously classified as classical T Tauri stars. This suggests that most of the X-ray emitting PMS stars in NGC 6530 are weak-line T Tauri stars. In addition to 9 Sgr, the EPIC field of view contains also a few early-type stars. This table contains information on 117 of the 119 X-ray sources (2 sources, a point source associated with 9 Sgr and an extended source associated with the Hourglass Nebula were excluded from this table by the authors) that were detected using the SAS source detection algorithms in the soft band (0.5 - 1.2 keV) of an EPIC observation of 9 Sgr which have either a combined likelihood &amp;amp;gt;= 20 and are detected in the individual images from all 3 EPIC instruments with -ln p_i &amp;amp;gt;= 3.0 or (in two cases) where clearly detected in 2 of the 3 instruments but fell outside of the FOV of the third. The faintest sources in this category have about 10-3 cts s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; over the 0.5 - 1.2 keV band of the MOS instruments.

The average angular separation between the X-ray source and the optical counterpart is 4.1 +/- 2.1 arcseconds. 17 X-ray sources have two or more optical stars falling within the 9 arcsec radius. Seven of these sources have at least one known H-alpha emission star inside their error box. 28 sources do not have an optical counterpart in the catalogue of Sung et al. The authors have cross-correlated these sources with the Guide Star Catalog and, in most cases, they find one or several GSC objects inside the 9 arcsec radius. These optical counterparts are usually very faint (V or R &amp;amp;gt;=17) except for sources 91, 92 and 94 that have counterparts with R magnitudes 15.0, 14.6 and 13.3 respectively (note that these sources fall outside the area investigated by Sung et al.). Sources 93, 96, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102 and 112 have no GSC counterpart. Most of the objects in Table 3 are therefore X-ray sources with high X-ray to visual luminosity ratios. Given the galactic coordinates of NGC 6530 (l_II = 6.14, b_II = -1.38), the total galactic column density along this line of sight must be extremely large and the number of extragalactic sources in the soft detection energy band should be extremely low.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=ngc6530xmm&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/ngc6530xmm.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

As a result, the present catalog of the FBS blue stellar objects (BSOs) has been compiled. Its preliminary version has been available at CDS since 1999. The author has revised and updated the FBS BSOs catalog with the new data from recently published optical and multi-wavelength catalogs to give access to all available data and make further comparative studies of the properties of these objects possible. The author has made cross-correlations of the FBS BSOs catalog with the MAPS , USNO-B1.0, SDSS, and 2MASS catalogs, as well as with ROSAT, IRAS, NVSS, and FIRST catalogs , added updated SIMBAD and NED data for the objects, and provided accurate DSS1 and DSS2 positions and revised photometry. The author also checked the objects for proper motion and variability. A refined classification for the low-dispersion spectra in the Digitized First Byurakan Survey (DFBS) was carried out.

The goal of these observations is to find all new gamma-ray active galactic nucleus (AGN) associations with radio sources &amp;amp;gt; 10 mJy at 8GHz. The authors observed with the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) the areas around unassociated sources, providing localizations of weak radio point sources found in 2FGL fields at arcminute scales. They then followed up a subset of these with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) and the Long Baseline Array (LBA) in order to confirm detections of radio emission on parsec-scales. The authors quantified association probabilities based on known statistics of source counts and assuming a uniform distribution of background sources. In total, they found 865 radio sources at arcsecond scales as candidates for association and detected 95 of 170 selected for follow-up observations at milliarcsecond resolution. Based on this, they obtained firm associations for 76 previously unknown gamma-ray AGNs. Comparison of these new AGN associations with the predictions from using the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) color-color diagram shows that half of the associations are missed. The authors found that in 129 out of 588 gamma-ray sources observed at arcminute scales not a single radio continuum source was detected above their sensitivity limit within the 3-sigma gamma-ray localization. These &amp;amp;quot;empty&amp;amp;quot; fields were found to be particularly concentrated at low Galactic latitudes. The nature of these Galactic gamma-ray emitters is not yet determined. A list of 216 target fields were observed with the VLA. The instantaneous bandwidth was split into two parts, with one half centered at 5.0 GHz (4.5 - 5.5 GHz) and the other centered at 7.3 GHz (6.8 - 7.8 GHz). The observations were made on 2012 October 26 and 2012 November 3. See section 2.1 of the reference paper for more details. These data are included in this HEASARC table. During the first campaign with the ATCA from 2012 September 19-20, the authors observed 411 2FGL unassociated sources in a Declination range of -90 degrees to +10 degrees at 5.5 and 9 GHz. The details of this observing campaign and results have been reported by Petrov et al. (2013, MNRAS, 432, 1294: available at the HEASARC as the AT2FGLUS table). The authors detected a total of 424 point sources. In a second ATCA campaign on 2013 September 25-28, the authors re-observed sources that were detected at 5 GHz, but were not detected at 9 GHz. See section 2.2 of the reference paper for more details. These data are included in this HEASARC table.

By using the (V-I) colors of the ASAS eclipsing binary catalog, the authors are able to determine the distances and thus bolometric luminosities for the majority of eclipsing binaries that display significant stellar activity. A typical value for the ratio of soft X-ray to bolometric luminosity is L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;/L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;bol&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ a few x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-4&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, similar to the ratio of soft X-ray to bolometric flux F&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;/F&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;bol&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; in the most active regions of the Sun.

The authors find evidence for the saturation effect and marginal evidence for the so-called &amp;amp;quot;super-saturation&amp;amp;quot; phenomena. Their work shows that wide-field stellar variability searches can produce a high yield of binary stars with strong coronal activity.

The reference paper describes the requirements for the contents of the 5th edition and the current state of the catalog in its new version, GCVS 5.1. The complete revision of information for variable stars in the constellation Carina and the compilation of the 81st Name-list of Variable Stars are considered as examples of work on the 5th edition. The GCVS 5.1 is freely accessible on the Internet. The authors recommend citing their paper as a unified reference to the 5th edition of the GCVS. The GCVS is the only reference source on all known variable stars. This version contains the electronically-readable version as distributed by the Sternberg Astronomical Institute and Institute of Astronomy (Russian Acad. Sci.), Moscow. This table is the catalog of variable stars, updated and completed with the Name-Lists of Variables Stars Nos. 67-79. After the publication of Volume III of the 4th edition of the GCVS, the subsequent Name-lists with numbers from 67 to 77 contained only names of variable stars in the GCVS systems, together with their coordinates and variability types. The authors actually started compiling the 5th edition of the GCVS ten years ago, with the 78th Name-list of Variable Stars, which provided (as did all subsequent Name-lists) complete GCVS information for each star (in addition to the variability types, ranges of brightness variations, epochs of brightness maxima or minima, periods, etc.). In all, the 78th-81st Name-lists contain more than 13300 variable stars. The complete revision of information on the coordinates of variable stars (see the Introduction section of the reference paper) was also a part of the transition to the 5th edition.

Also, there are 160 objects that are non-existing, non-stellar, or stars erroneously named for the second time (these objects are contained in the present table but will not be found in positional searches as they have been assigned null values for their positional coordinates: they can be located by searching for objects whose Right Ascensions are &apos;!&amp;amp;gt; 00 00 00&apos;). The stars of the GCVS 5.1 are stars of the GCVS fourth edition plus the stars from Name-lists Nos. 67-81. The stars from the Name-lists Nos. 78-81 are presented in the complete GCVS format. Complete information for stars of the Name-lists Nos. 67-77 is so far provided in the first 18 constellations (Andromeda to Cassiopeia). In these constellations, the GCVS information has been completely revised with active use of new publications as well as observations retrieved by the GCVS compilers by data mining and used to determine new variability types and new light elements whenever possible. The authors are continuing this work and will introduce new data for the next constellations as soon as they are ready. Upon recommendations of the IAU Commissions 27 and 42, in 2006, they have developed a new experimental system of classification for variable stars.

This survey comprises deep wide-field observations in total intensity, linear polarization, and circular polarization over the Chandra Deep Field-South (CDF-S) and European Large Area Infrared Space Observatory Survey (ELAIS)-South 1 regions. DR2 improves upon the first data release by maintaining consistent data reductions across the two regions, including polarization analysis, and including differential number counts in total intensity and linear polarization. Typical DR2 sensitivities across the mosaicked multi-pointing images are 30 microJy per beam at approximately 12 arcseconds by 6 arcseconds resolution over a combined area of 6.4 square degrees. In their paper, the authors present detailed descriptions of their data reduction and analysis procedures, including corrections for instrumental effects such as positional variations in image sensitivity, bandwidth smearing with a non-circular beam, and polarization leakage, and application of the BLOBCAT source extractor. They present the DR2 images and catalogs of components (discrete regions of radio emission) and sources (groups of physically associated radio components), and describe new analytic methods to account for resolution bias and Eddington bias when constructing differential number counts of radio components. The authors use the term &apos;component&apos; to refer to an isolated region of emission that is best described by a single 2D elliptical Gaussian. Blended regions of contiguous emission may consist of multiple individual components. Following the terminology from Hales et al. (2012, MNRAS, 425, 979), a &apos;blob&apos; is an agglomerated island of pixels above an SNR cutoff, which may encapsulate a single component or a blended region of emission.

The catalog contains source detections drawn from a total of 10,242 XMM-Newton EPIC observations covering an energy interval from 0.2 keV to 12 keV that were made between 2000 February 3 and 2017 November 30; all datasets included were publicly available by 2017 December 31 but not all public observations are included in this catalog. For net exposure time &amp;amp;gt;= 1 ksec, the total area of the catalogue fields is ~ 2,010 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; but taking account of the substantial overlaps between observations, the net sky area covered independently is ~ 1,089 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;. The catalog contains 775,153 X-ray source detections above the processing likelihood threshold of 6. These X-ray source detections relate to 531,454 unique X-ray sources, that is, a significant fraction of sources (99,580, 19%) have more than one detection in the catalog (up to 59 repeat observations in the most extreme case). The catalog distinguishes between extended emission and point-like detections. Parameters of detections of extended sources are only reliable up to the maximum extent measure of 80 arcseconds. There are 70,887 detections of extended emission, of which 16,196 are &apos;clean&apos; (in the sense that they were not manually flagged) and 12,256 comprise the &apos;cleanest&apos; set where no flags are set and they are not in fields with high background levels. Due to intrinsic features of the instrumentation as well as some shortcomings of the source detection process, some detections are considered to be spurious or their parameters are considered to be unreliable. It is recommended to use a detection flag and an observation flag (and, possibly, a high background flag) as filters to obtain what can be considered a &apos;clean&apos; sample. There are 633,733 out of 775,153 detections that are considered to be clean (i.e., summary flag &amp;amp;lt; 3). For 173,208 detections, EPIC spectra and time series were automatically extracted during processing, and a chi&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;-variability test was applied to the time series. 5,934 detections in the catalog are considered variable, within the timespan of the specific observation, at a probability of 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-5&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; or less based on the null-hypothesis that the source is constant. Of these, 3,603 have a summary flag value &amp;amp;lt; 3. The median flux (in the total photon-energy band from 0.2 - 12 keV) of the catalog detections is ~ 2.2 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-14&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg/cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;/s; in the soft energy band (0.2 - 2 keV) the median flux is ~ 5.2 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-15&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, and in the hard band (2 - 12 keV) it is ~ 1.2 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-14&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;. About 23% of the sources have fluxes below 1 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-14&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg/cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;/s. The flux values from the three EPIC cameras are, overall, in agreement to ~ 10% for most energy bands. The median positional accuracy of the catalog point source detections is generally &amp;amp;lt; 1.6 arcseconds (with a standard deviation of 1.39 arcseconds). About a fifth of the observations have features that may cause spurious detections (mainly the wings of bright sources and large extended emission), and it is strongly recommended to use a filter, both per source, based on the summary flag parameter (sum_flag), and per observation, based on the observation class parameter (obs_class). The energy bands used in the 3XMM-DR8 processing were the same as for the 2XMM catalog. Table 1: Energy bands used in 3XMM-DR8 processing The following are the basic energy bands: &amp;amp;lt;pre&amp;amp;gt; 1 = 0.2 - 0.5 keV 2 = 0.5 - 1.0 keV 3 = 1.0 - 2.0 keV 4 = 2.0 - 4.5 keV 5 = 4.5 - 12.0 keV &amp;amp;lt;/pre&amp;amp;gt; while these are the broad energy bands: &amp;amp;lt;pre&amp;amp;gt; 6 = 0.2 - 2.0 keV soft band, no images made 7 = 2.0 - 12.0 keV hard band, no images made 8 = 0.2 - 12.0 keV total band 9 = 0.5 - 4.5 keV XID band &amp;amp;lt;/pre&amp;amp;gt;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=xmmssc&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/xmmssc.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

This sample was used by the authors to study the relationship between rotation and stellar activity and derive a new estimate of the convective turnover time. From an unbiased subset of this sample the power law slope of the unsaturated regime, L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;/L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;bol&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ R&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;o&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;beta&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, is fit as beta = -2.70 +/- 0.13. This is inconsistent with the canonical beta = -2 slope to a confidence of 5 sigma, and argues for an additional term in the dynamo number equation. From a simple scaling analysis, this implies Delta(Omega)/Omega ~ Omega&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;0.7&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, i.e. the differential rotation of solar-type stars gradually declines as they spin down. Super-saturation is observed for the fastest rotators in this sample and its parametric dependencies are explored. Significant correlations are found with both the corotation radius and the excess polar updraft, the latter theory providing a stronger dependence and being supported by other observations. The authors estimate mass-dependent empirical thresholds for saturation and super- saturation and map out three regimes of coronal emission. Late F-type stars are shown never to pass through the saturated regime, passing straight from super-saturated to unsaturated X-ray emission. The theoretical threshold for coronal stripping is shown to be significantly different from the empirical saturation threshold (R&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;o&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt; 0.13), suggesting it is not responsible. Instead, the authors suggest that a different dynamo configuration is at work in stars with saturated coronal emission. This is supported by a correlation between the empirical saturation threshold and the time when stars transition between convective and interface sequences in rotational spin-down models.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=rotxraycat&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/rotxraycat.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

So far the number of known blazars is of the order of several hundreds, but the forthcoming AGILE, GLAST and Planck space observatories will detect several thousand of objects of this type. In preparation for these missions it is necessary to identify new samples of blazars to study their multi-frequency characteristics and statistical properties. The authors have compiled a sample of objects with blazar-like properties via a cross-correlation between large radio (NVSS, ATCAPMN) and X-ray surveys (RASS) using the SDSS-DR4 and 2dF survey data to spectroscopically identify their candidates and test the validity of the selection method. They present the Radio-Optical-X-ray catalog built at ASDC (ROXA), a list of 816 objects among which 510 are confirmed blazars. Only 19% of the candidates turned out to be certainly non-blazars, demonstrating the high efficiency of our selection method. This catalog includes 173 new blazar identifications, or about 10% of all presently known blazars. The relatively high flux threshold in the X-ray energy band (given by the RASS survey) preferentially selects objects with high F_X/F_r ratio, leading to the discovery of new High Energy Peaked BL Lac (HBLs). This catalog therefore includes many new potential targets for GeV-TeV observations. The selection method consisted of three steps: 1) a first cross-correlation between radio and X-ray surveys (the NRAO VLA Sky Survey, ATCAPMN (ATCA catalogue of compact PMN sources) and ROSAT All Sky Survey; 2) for each radio/X-ray match, optical magnitudes were retrieved from the Guide Star Catalog; 3) for all radio/optical/X-ray matches the authors calculated the X-ray to optical (alpha_ox) and radio to optical (alpha_ro) spectral slopes and took only sources with alpha_ox and alpha_ro values within the blazar area. For each object, redshift, B and G magnitudes, radio fluxes at 1.4 GHz and at 5 GHz, X-ray flux, F_X/F_r ratio, X-ray luminosity, radio luminosity, Ca H&amp;amp;amp;K break and classification are given.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=roxa&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/roxa.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The survey was made using six separate pointings of the Very Large Array with over 40 hr of observation per pointing. In the current study, the authors improve on the data reduction to produce a second data release (DR2) mosaic image. This DR2 image covers an area of about a third of a square degree, reaches a best rms sensitivity of 6 microJy (uJy), and has a typical sensitivity of 7.4 uJy per 2.8&amp;amp;quot; by 1.6&amp;amp;quot; beam. The authors also present a more comprehensive catalog, including sources down to peak flux densities of five or more times the local rms noise, along with information on source sizes and relevant pointing data. In their paper, they discuss in some detail the consideration of whether sources are resolved under the complication of a radio image created as a mosaic of separate pointings, each suffering some degree of bandwidth smearing, and the accurate evaluation of the flux densities of such sources. Finally, the radio morphologies and optical/near-IR counterpart identifications are used to identify 17 likely multiple-component sources so as to arrive at a catalog of 883 radio sources (and also 49 individual components of the 17 multi-component sources), which is roughly double the number of sources contained in the first data release. In order to cover the full E-CDF-S area at near-uniform sensitivity, the authors pointed the VLA at six separate coordinate locations arranged in a hexagonal grid around the adopted center of the CDF-S, viz. RA, Dec (J2000) 03&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;h&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; 32&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;m&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; 28.00&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;s&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, -27&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;o&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; 48&apos; 30.0&amp;amp;quot;. The observations were spread over many days on account of the low declination of the field and typically amounted to 5 hr of time per calendar date.

This HEASARC table contains the catalog of 883 radio sources (Table 3 in the reference paper) and also the catalog of 49 individual components of the 17 multi-component sources (Table 4 in the reference paper), so that there are a total of 932 entries in the present table. To allow users to easily distinguish these types of entry, the HEASARC created a parameter type_flag which is set to &apos;S&apos; for the 883 source entries and to &apos;C&apos; for the 49 component entries. The HEASARC created names for the sources following the standard CDS and IAU recommendations for position-based names and using the prefix of &apos;[MBF2013]&apos; for Miller, Bonzini, Fomalont (2013), the first 3 authors and the date of publication of the reference paper. For the components, we have used the names based on the positions of the parent sources and the suffixes &apos;A&apos;, &apos;B&apos;, etc, in order of increasing J2000.0 RA.

The steepness (power-law slope) of the luminosity-temperature (L-T) relation, L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ kT&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;alpha&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, in the range of kT ~ 1.5 - 15 keV is alpha = 3.17 +/- 0.15, consistent with previous measurements. In the relation, the authors find two breaks at around intracluster medium (ICM) temperatures of 1 keV and 4 keV: alpha = 2.34 +/- 0.29 above 4 keV, 3.74 +/- 0.32 in the 1.5 to 5 keV range, and 4.03 +/- 1.07 below 1.5 keV. Two such breaks are also evident in the temperature and size relation. The steepness in the L-T relation at kT &amp;amp;gt; 4 keV is consistent with the scale-relation derived from the CDM model, indicating that the gravitational effect is dominant in richer clusters, while poorer clusters suffer non-gravity effects. The steep L-T relation below 1 keV is mostly attributed to X-ray faint systems of elliptical galaxies and galaxy groups. The authors find that the ICM mass within the scaling radius R&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;1500&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; (the radius within which the averaged mass density is 1500 times higher than the critical density) follows the relation of M&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;gas&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ T&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;(2.33+/-0.07)&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; from X-ray faint galaxies to rich clusters. Thus, the authors speculate that even such X-ray faint systems contain large-scale hot gas, which is too faint to detect. For this project, the authors utilized all of the ASCA data of elliptical galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Several clusters were observed more than once, and they chose the observation with the longest exposure. The total number of objects that the authors identified as elliptical galaxies and clusters was 313, and these are listed in this table. Some of the objects could not be utilized for deriving various correlations, due to either having an unknown redshift (17 objects), an insignificant detection (13 objects listed below), or contamination of the environmental X-ray emission, such as cluster emission around non-cD elliptical galaxies (10 objects: NGC 4472, NGC 4406, NGC 4374, NGC 1404, NGC 499, NGC 6034, NGC 2865, NGC 4291, CL 2236-04 and RX J1031.6-2607). Thus, the authors analyzed the ASCA data for 292 objects, among which were ~ 50 elliptical galaxies and galaxy groups. In this study, the authors assumed the Hubble constant to be 50 h&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;50&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; km s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; Mpc&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; and q&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;0&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; to be 0.

To help elucidate the nature of the nebula, the authors&apos; goal was to reconstruct the star-formation history of the CMa R1 region, including the previously unknown older, fainter low-mass stellar population, using X-rays. The authors analyzed images obtained with the ROSAT satellite, covering ~5 square degrees. Complementary VRI photometry was performed with the Gemini South telescope. Color-magnitude and color-color diagrams were used in conjunction with pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks to derive the masses and ages of the X-ray sources. The ROSAT images show two distinct clusters. One is associated with the known optical clusters near Z CMa, to which ~ 40 members are added. The other, which the authors name the &amp;amp;quot;GU CMa&amp;amp;quot; cluster, is new, and contains ~ 60 members. The ROSAT sources are young stars with masses down to M_star ~ 0.5 M_sun, and ages up to 10 Myr. The mass functions of the two clusters are similar, but the GU CMa cluster is older than the cluster around Z CMa by at least a few Myr. Also, the GU CMa cluster is away from any molecular cloud, implying that star formation must have ceased; on the contrary (as already known), star formation is very active in the Z CMa region.

The unusual aspect of this detector is that the location of the gamma-ray on the sky is given by an annulus and not a point. The correlation of many events enables the localization of point sources or the creation of sky maps. Time-of-flight measurements, pulse shape discrimination and anti-coincidence shields are used to reject background events. COMPTEL has a wide field of view (about 1 steradian, equivalent to a FWHM of about 40 degrees), an angular resolution under optimal conditions of about 1 degree, and an energy resolution that ranges from 5-10% at 1 MeV. During Phase 1 of the CGRO mission, COMPTEL completed the first all-sky survey in the energy range of 0.75-30 MeV (in four energy bands). In addition, COMPTEL can measure energy spectra of solar flares or bright cosmic gamma-ray bursts between 0.1-10 MeV, and neutrons from solar flares.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=comptel&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/comptel.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

It depends mainly on a preliminary version (Spring 1989) of the new General Catalogue of Trigonometric Parallaxes (YPC) prepared by Dr. William F. van Altena (Yale University). The catalog contains every then-known star with a trigonometric parallax greater than or equal to 0.0390 arcsec, even though it may be evident from photometry or for other reasons that the star has a larger distance. For red dwarf stars, new color-magnitude calibrations for broad-band colors were carried out and applied. For white dwarfs, the recipes of McCook and Sion in ApJS, 65, 603 (1987) were applied. Stroemgren photometry was used (not yet systematically) for early-type stars and for late dwarfs, the latter supplied by E. H. Olsen from Copenhagen Observatory (private communication). In contrast to the CNS2 (Gliese 1969) catalog, trigonometric parallaxes and photometric or spectroscopic parallaxes were not combined in this version. The resulting parallax in the present version is the trigonometric parallax if the relative error of the trigonometric parallax is smaller than 14 percent. The parallax may be the photometric or spectroscopic parallax only if no trigonometric parallax is available or if the standard error of the trigonometric parallax is considerably larger.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=cns3&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/cns3.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

In agreement with previous results, the authors find that HMXBs are a good tracer of the recent star formation activity in the host galaxy and their collective luminosity and number scale with the SFR, in particular, L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ 2.6 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;39&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; x SFR. However, the scaling relations still bear a rather large dispersion of rms ~ 0.4 dex, which the authors believe is of a physical origin. This table contains the catalog of 1055 compact X-ray sources detected within the D25 ellipse for galaxies of this sample which the authors used to construct the average X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of HMXBs with substantially improved statistical accuracy and better control of systematic effects than achieved in previous studies. The XLF follows a power law with slope of 1.6 in the log(L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;) ~ 35 - 40 luminosity range with a moderately significant evidence for a break or cut-off at L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;40&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg/s. As before, the authors did not find any features at the Eddington limit for a neutron star or a stellar mass black hole. In their paper, the authors discuss the implications of their results for the theory of binary evolution. In particular, they estimate the fraction of compact objects that once during their lifetime experienced an X-ray active phase powered by accretion from a high mass companion and obtain a rather large number, f&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ 0.2 x (0.1 Myr/tau&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;x&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;), where tau&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;x&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; is the life time of the X-ray active phase. This is about 4 orders of magnitude more frequent than in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). The authors also derive constrains on the mass distribution of the secondary star in HMXBs. Note that, in their paper, the authors estimate that ~ 300 of the 1055 sources are likely to be background AGNs (cosmic X-ray background or CXB sources) and that the majority (&amp;amp;lt;~ 700) of the remaining ~ 750 sources are young HMXB systems associated with star formation in their host galaxies.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=sfgalhmxb&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/sfgalhmxb.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

There are 276 sources with spectroscopic redshifts and classifications, largely resulting from the authors&apos; extensive campaign of ground-based spectroscopic follow-up. The authors characterize the overall sample in terms of the X-ray, optical, and infrared source properties. The sample is primarily composed of active galactic nuclei (AGN), detected over a large range in redshift from z = 0.002 to 3.4 (median redshift z of 0.56), but also includes 16 spectroscopically confirmed Galactic sources. There is a large range in X-ray flux, from log (f_3-24_keV) ~ -14 to -11 (in units of erg s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;), and in rest-frame 10-40 keV luminosity, from log (L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;10-40keV&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;) ~ 39 to 46 (in units of erg s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;), with a median of 44.1.

These sources are listed in Table 7 of the reference paper. This method was developed alongside the primary one (Section 2.3 of the reference paper) in order to investigate the optimum source detection methodologies for NuSTAR and to identify sources in regions of the NuSTAR coverage that are automatically excluded in the primary source detection. The authors emphasize that these secondary sources are not used in any of the science analyses presented in their paper. Nevertheless, these secondary sources are robust NuSTAR detections, some of which will be incorporated in future NuSTAR studies, and for many of them (35 out of the 43 sources with spectroscopic identifications) the authors have obtained new spectroscopic redshifts and classifications through their follow-up program. The X-ray photometric parameters for 4 sources are left blank as in these cases the A+B data prohibit reliable photometric constraints.

The authors followed the same identification scheme and used, among other information, X-ray hardness ratios and spatial extent to classify unknown sources as candidates for active galactic nuclei (AGN), foreground stars, supernova remnants (SNRs), supersoft sources (SSSs) and X-ray binaries. In Table 7 of the paper from which this catalog is taken (Haberl et al. 2000, A&amp;amp;amp;AS, 142, 41), for 158 of these 517 sources a likely source type is given, from which 46 sources are suggested as background AGN (including candidates resulting from a comparison of X-ray and radio images). Nearly all of the X-ray binaries known in the SMC were detected in the ROSAT PSPC observations; most of them with luminosities below 10^36 erg/s, suggesting that the fraction of high-luminosity X-ray binary systems in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) is not significantly larger than in our galaxy.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=smcrosxry2&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/smcrosxry2.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

These data were obtained using the survey scanners and the Deep Survey instrument during the first year of the spectroscopic guest observer phase of the mission, from January 1993 to January 1994. The data set consists of 162 discrete pointings whose exposure times are typically two orders of magnitude longer than the average exposure times during the EUVE all-sky survey. Based on these results, the authors expect that EUVE will serendipitously detect approximately 100 new EUV sources per year, or about one new EUV source per 10 square degrees, during the guest observer phase of the EUVE mission. New EUVE sources of note include one B star and three extragalactic objects. The B star (HR 2875, EUVE J0729 - 38.7) is detected in both the Lexan/B (approximately 100 A) and Al/Ti/C (approximately 200 A) bandpasses, and the detection is shown not to be a result of UV leaks. The authors suggest that they are detecting EUV and/or soft x rays from a companion to the B star. Three sources, EUVE J2132+10.1, EUVE J2343-14.9, and EUVE J2359-30.6 are identified as the active galactic nuclei MKN 1513, MS2340.9-1511, and 1H2354-315, respectively. Some of the EUV sources have two or more alternative source identifications suggested for them in this catalog. Notice that, in such cases, the HEASARC has followed the structure of the original catalog as given in Table 2 of the reference paper, and lists separate entries for these alternative identifications.

Plausible optical, X-ray, radio, and/or UV identifications are available for about 65% of the EUV sources. The EUVE all-sky survey detections (indicated by detect_mode = EASS in this catalog) comprise 514 detected EUV-emitting objects, the deep-survey detections (indicated by detect_mode = DS in this catalog) comprise 35 detected objects, and the sources detected during other phases of the mission (indicated by detect_mode = OTHER in this database) comprise 188 detected objects. Notice that 3 deep survey objects were also detected in the all-sky survey. Most of the sources detected in the other phases principally comprise those detected in deep exposures with the scanner telescopes as part of the Right Angle Program through December 24, 1994, or in long exposures with the deep survey instrument. Because these latter objects were observed with a variety of instruments and exposure strategies, the flux limits and detection thresholds vary over a wide range, and the Bowyer et al. reference should be consulted for more details.

The combined catalog contains a total of 153 X-ray sources, of which 42 are detected only in the soft band and 21 are detected only in the hard band. Confirming previous Chandra results, the authors find that the fainter sources have harder X-ray spectra, providing a consistent solution to the long-standing &amp;amp;quot;spectral paradox&amp;amp;quot;. From deep optical and near-infrared follow-up data, 77% of the X-ray sources have optical counterparts to I = 24, and 71% of the X-ray sources have near-infrared counterparts to K&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;s&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; = 20.

The authors have obtained spectroscopic redshifts with the Keck telescopes of 18 of the Lynx Chandra sources. These sources comprise a mix of broad-lined active galaxies, apparently normal galaxies, and two late-type Galactic dwarfs. Intriguingly, one Galactic source (number 72) is identified with an M7 dwarf exhibiting non-transient, hard X-ray emission. Thirteen of the Chandra sources are located within regions for which the authors have Hubble Space Telescope imaging. Nine of the sources are detected, showing a range of morphologies: several show compact cores embedded within diffuse emission, while others are spatially extended showing typical galaxy morphologies. Two of the Chandra sources in this subsample appear to be associated with mergers. ACIS-I observations of the Lynx field were obtained on 2000 May 3 (65 ks; OBS-ID 1708) and 2000 May 4 (125 ks; OBS-ID 927).

This procedure gave 60.7 ks of effective exposure out of the first observation and 124 ks out of the second, for a total of 184.7 ks. The two observations are almost coincident on the sky, so that the total coverage is 298 arcmin&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;.

The S2/68 experiment has been described by Boksenberg et al. (1973MNRAS.163..291B), and the absolute calibration by Humphries et al. (1976A&amp;amp;amp;A....49..389H). The TD1 Catalog of Stellar Ultraviolet Fluxes represents results from the sky-scan experiment on the TD1 satellite of the European Space Research Organization (ESRO), now part of ESA. It lists the absolute fluxes, in four passbands, for 31,215 stars: &amp;amp;lt;pre&amp;amp;gt; Passband Center: 274.0nm 236.5nm 196.5nm 156.5nm Effective Width: 31.0nm 33.0nm 33.0nm 33.0nm &amp;amp;lt;/pre&amp;amp;gt; The stars have been selected subject to the constraint that the signal-to-noise ratio should be at least 10.0 in any one of the four passbands. Null values of a flux field and an error field indicate there are no valid data for the star. This usually arises with close pairs of stars whose spectra overlap. Five standard flux error values are greater than 99.99, and were too large for the format of the flux field in the original table. Thus, the flux error values which were greater than 99.99 are given as 99.99. Many of the fainter stars of spectral type later than A5 do not have significant signals in all of the spectrophotometric channels (particularly the 1565A channel). Consequently, after the removal of the background, they can randomly give rise to small negative values of flux. Those negative values were not suppressed, but are given together with their error, as they can be significant when considered as part of a statistical sample. Although the sky coverage is essentially complete, the catalog does not contain the fluxes for all stars that fall within the limit of the sensitivity of the instrument. If any star expected to be present is missing, then its signal is probably blended with that of a nearby star, in which case the data have been discarded.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=td1&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/td1.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

Five X-ray sources were found inside the cluster core radius, including the known eclipsing binary millisecond pulsar (MSP) PSR J1953+1846A. The X-ray light curve of the source coincident with this MSP shows marginal evidence for periodicity at the binary period of 4.2hr. Its hard X-ray spectrum and luminosity resemble those of other eclipsing binary MSPs in 47 Tuc, suggesting a similar shock origin of the X-ray emission.

They searched for X-ray sources in the observed field by employing techniques described in Tennant (2006, AJ, 132, 1372) which use a circular Gaussian approximation to the point-spread function (PSF). Within twice the M71 half-mass radius (r&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;h&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; = 1.65 arcminutes), they set the signal-to-noise threshold (S/N) for detection to 2.0, but also required the number of source counts to be at least 5 times the statistical uncertainty in the local background estimate. The empirical relation derived by Tennant, C&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;min&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; = (S/N)&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;/0.81, then implies a point-source sensitivity limit of about 4.9 counts for r&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;M71&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;= 2r&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;h&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; and in the energy band 0.3-8.0 keV.

The principal activity of IRAM is the study of cold matter (molecular gas and dust) in the solar system, in our Galaxy, and out to cosmological distances, in order to determine its composition, density, mass, temperature, and kinematics. IRAM operates two observatories at millimeter wavelengths which are open to the international astronomical community: the 30-m single-dish telescope on Pico Veleta (2850 m), Spain, and the six-antenna interferometer on the Plateau de Bure (2550 m) in France. Both sites are at high altitude to reduce the absorption by water vapor. The observatories are supported by the IRAM offices and laboratories in Granada and Grenoble. The observation log included here concerns NOEMA, the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array, and summarizes the observations made there. NOEMA is the successor to the Plateau de Bure observatory. During its history, the observatory at the Plateau de Bure underwent several track extensions, received additional antennas (all of 15-m diameter and of similar construction to the first ones) and technical upgrades. From a three-antenna interferometer with a maximum baseline of 288 meters in 1988, it has evolved to a eight-antenna array with baselines up to 760 meters in 2016. With the inauguration of the seventh antenna in September, 2014, the observatory started its transformation into NOEMA. More information about NOEMA is &amp;amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iram.fr/IRAMFR/GILDAS/doc/html/noema-intro-html/noema-intro.html&quot;&amp;amp;gt;available at the IRAM web site&amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;gt;.

This work brings the total number of known or reasonably suspected OB stars to over 16,000. This catalog contains UBV photometry and MK spectral type classifications for these objects as well as radial velocities. This project originated in the summer of 1991 when the author began compiling a cross-reference catalog and tabulation of published UBVbeta photometry for stars listed in Stephenson and Sanduleak&apos;s Luminous Stars (LS) in the Southern Milky Way Catalog (CDS Cat. III/43). This database was published in July 1993 (Reed 1993, ApJS, 87, 367) and was subsequently expanded to include compilations of published MK classifications (Reed &amp;amp;amp; Beatty 1995, ApJS, 97, 189), 4-color photometry (Read 1996, A&amp;amp;amp;AS, 117, 313), and radial velocities (Reed &amp;amp;amp; Kuhna 1997, AJ, 113, 823) for these objects. In mid-1997 the project was again expanded to include UBVbeta photometry for stars listed in the Northern-hemisphere volumes of the &amp;amp;quot;Case-Hamburg&amp;amp;quot; (CDS Cat. III/76) surveys (Reed 1998, ApJS, 115, 271); MK classifications for the Northern stars were similarly compiled and made electronically available to interested parties, though they were not formally published. Most of the LS objects are OB stars, but there are as well a number of A, F, and G supergiants and a few white dwarfs and Wolf Rayet stars. These surveys reached a limiting photographic magnitude of ~13.5, and were based on objective-prism surveys of dispersion 580 Angstrom/mm at H-gamma. OB stars is here taken to mean main-sequence stars down to temperature class B2 and more luminous ones down to temperature class B9. The original Case-Hamburg surveys (about 12,000 stars) also include some 2,000 evolved A-G stars, along with some white dwarfs, planetary nebulae, and Wolf-Rayet stars. It is worth noting that the definition of an OB star is not universal; for example, Vanbeveren et al. (1998, in &amp;amp;quot;The Brightest Stars&amp;amp;quot;) define them as O-B2 V-IV, O-B3 III, O-B4 II, and all OBA Ib, Iab, Ia, and IaO stars.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=galobstars&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/galobstars.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

Optical studies lead to a different evolutionary behaviour, with a number density peaking at z ~ 2 independently of the intrinsic luminosity, but this result is limited to active nuclei brighter than the host galaxy. A selection based on optical variability can detect low luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs), where the host galaxy light prevents the identification by non-stellar colours. The authors collected X-ray data in a field where there existed an optically-selected sample of &amp;amp;quot;variable galaxies&amp;amp;quot;, i.e. variable objects with diffuse appearance, in order to investigate the X-ray and optical properties of the population of AGNs, particularly of low luminosity ones, where the host galaxy is visible. They observed a field of ~ 0.2 deg^2 in the Selected Area 57, for 67 ks with XMM-Newton. They correlated the list of detected X-ray sources with a photographic survey of SA 57, complete to B_J ~ 23 and with the available spectroscopic data. They obtained a catalog of 140 X-ray sources to limiting fluxes of 5 x 10^-16 and 2 x 10^-15 erg/cm^2/s in the 0.5 - 2 keV and 2 - 10 keV bands, respectively, 98 of which are identified in the optical bands. The X-ray detection of part of the variability-selected candidates confirms their AGN nature. Diffuse variable objects populate the low luminosity side of the sample. Only 25/44 optically-selected QSOs are detected in X-rays. 15% of all QSOs in the field have X/O &amp;amp;lt; 0.1.

In the reference paper, a catalog of 22,563 point sources and 442 extended sources, and the number counts of the AGN and galaxy cluster populations are presented. SACS provides excellent constraints on the AGN number counts at the bright end with negligible uncertainties due to cosmic variance, and these constraints are consistent with previous measurements. The authors use Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mid-infrared(MIR) colors to classify the sources. For AGNs, they can roughly separate the point sources into MIR-red and MIR-blue AGNs, finding roughly equal numbers of each type in the soft X-ray band (0.5-2.0 keV), but fewer MIR-blue sources in the hard X-ray band (2-8 keV). The cluster number counts, with 5% uncertainties from cosmic variance, are also consistent with previous surveys but span a much larger continuous flux range. Deep optical or IR followup observations of this cluster sample will significantly increase the number of higher redshift (z &amp;amp;gt; 0.5) X-ray-selected clusters.

The sample covers the celestial region with declination &amp;amp;gt;=0 degrees and Galactic latitude |b| &amp;amp;gt;= 20 degrees, and comprises sources with a Position Sensitive Proportional Counter (PSPC) count rate &amp;amp;gt;= 0.06 counts/s and a source extent likelihood of L &amp;amp;gt;= 7. In an optical follow-up identification program, the authors found 378 (76%) of these sources to be clusters of galaxies. It was necessary to reanalyze the sources in this sample with a new X-ray source characterization technique to provide more precise values for the X-ray flux and source extent than obtained from the standard processing. This new method, termed growth curve analysis (GCA), has the advantage over previous methods in its ability to be robust, to be easy to model and to integrate into simulations, to provide diagnostic plots for visual inspection, and to make extensive use of the X-ray data. The source parameters obtained assist the source identification and provide more precise X-ray fluxes. This reanalysis is based on data from the more recent second processing of the ROSAT Survey, RASS II. The authors present a catalog of the cluster sources with the X-ray properties obtained as well as a list of the previously flagged extended sources that are found to have a non-cluster counterpart. In their paper, they discuss the process of source identification from the combination of optical and X-ray data. To investigate the overall completeness of the cluster sample as a function of the X-ray flux limit, they extended the search for X-ray cluster sources to the RASS II data for the northern sky region between 9 and 14 hours in right ascension. They included the search for X-ray emission from known galaxy clusters as well as a new investigation of extended X-ray sources. In the course of this search, they found X-ray emission from 85 additional Abell clusters and 56 very probable cluster candidates among the newly found extended sources. A comparison of the X-ray cluster number counts of the NORAS sample with the ROSAT-ESO Flux-limited X-ray (REFLEX) Cluster Survey results leads to an estimate of the completeness of the NORAS sample of ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS) I extended clusters of about 50% at an X-ray flux of FX(0.1-2.4 keV) = 3 x 10-12 ergs s^-1 cm^-2. The estimated completeness achieved by adding the supplementary sample in the study area amounts to about 82% in comparison to REFLEX. The low completeness introduces an uncertainty in the use of the sample for cosmological statistical studies that will be cured with the completion of the continuing Northern ROSAT All-Sky (NORAS) Cluster Survey project.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=noras&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/noras.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

Following the same procedure as in the first release of the LQAC, the authors aim is to compile all the quasars recorded up until the present date, with the best determination of their ICRS equatorial coordinates, i.e., with respect to the newly established ICRF2 (the second realization of the International Celestial Reference Frame) and with the maximum of information concerning their physical properties, e.g., redshifts, photometry, absolute magnitudes. In the second paper, the authors first of all made a substantial review of the definitions and properties of quasars and AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei), the differentiation of these objects being unclear in the literature and even for specialists. This served their purpose when deciding which kinds of objects would be taken into account in this compilation. Then, they carried out the cross-identification between the 9 catalogs of quasars chosen for their accuracy and their huge number of objects, using a flag for each of them, and including all the available data related to magnitudes (infrared and optical), radio fluxes and redshifts. They also performed cross identification with external catalogs 2MASS, B1.0 and GSC2.3 in order to complete photometric data for the objects. Moreover, they computed the absolute magnitude of their extragalactic objects by taking into account recent studies concerning Galactic absorption. In addition, substantial improvements were brought with respect to the first release of the LQAC. First, an LQAC name was given for each object based on its equatorial coordinates with respect to the ICRS, following a procedure which creates no ambiguity for identification. Secondly, the equatorial coordinates of the objects were recomputed more accurately according to the algorithms used for the elaboration of the Large Quasar Reference Frame (LQRF) (Andrei et al., 2009, CDS Cat. I/313). Thirdly, the authors introduced a morphological classification for the objects which enabled them in particular to define clearly if the object is point-like or extended. The authors adopted a cosmology with H&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;0&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; = 70 km s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; Mpc&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, Omega&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;M&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; = 0.3, Omega&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;Lambda&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; = 0.7, and q&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;0&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; = -0.65 in LQAC-3 (which is slightly different from that adopted for LQAC-2, notice). The final catalog, called LQAC-2, contained 187,504 quasars. This was roughly 65% larger than the 113,666 quasars recorded in the first version of the LQAC (Souchay et al. 2009, CDS Cat. J/A+A/494/799) and a little more than the number of quasars recorded in the up-dated version of the Veron-Cetty and Veron (2010, CDS Cat. VII/258, HEASARC VERONCAT table) catalog, which was the densest compilation of quasars up to the present one. In addition to the quantitative and qualitative improvements implemented in this compilation, the authors discussed the homogeneity of the data and carried out a statistical analysis concerning the spatial density and the distance to the nearest neighbor in their published paper. The authors adopted a cosmology with H&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;0&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; = 72 km s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; Mpc&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; and q&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;0&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; = -0.58 in this study. From an astrometric point of view, quasars constitute quasi-ideal reference objects in the celestial sphere, with an a priori absence of proper motion. Since the second release of the LQAC, a large number of quasars have been discovered, in particular with the upcoming new release of the SDSS quasars catalog. Following the same procedure as in the two previous releases of the LQAC, The authors&apos; aim for LQAC-3 was to compile all the quasars recorded until the present date, with accurate recomputation of their equatorial coordinates in the ICRS and with the maximum of information concerning their physical properties, such as the redshift, the photometry, and the absolute magnitudes. The authors carried out the cross-identification between the 9 catalogs of quasars chosen for their huge number of objects, including all the available data related to magnitudes, radio fluxes, and redshifts. This cross identification was particularly delicate because of a slight change in coordinates between the objects common to two successive releases of the SDSS and the elimination of some of them. Equatorial coordinates were recomputed more accurately according to the algorithms used for the elaboration of the Large Quasar Reference Frame (LQRF). Moreover, absolute magnitudes and morphological indexes of the new objects were given, following the same method as in the LQAC-2. The final catalog, called LQAC-3, contains 321,957 objects including a small proportion of AGNs (14,128) and BL Lac objects (1,183). This is roughly 70% more than the number of objects recorded in the LQAC-2. The LQAC-3 will be useful for the astronomical community since it gives the most complete information available about the whole set of already recorded quasars, with emphasis on the precision and accuracy of their coordinates with respect to the ICRF2.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=lqac&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/lqac.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

In this table, the catalog of 10,830 radio sources down to 5 sigma is presented, out of which 67 are combined from multiple components. Comparing the positions of these 3-GHz sources with those from the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA)-COSMOS survey, the authors estimate that the astrometry is accurate to 0.01 arcseconds at the bright end (signal-to-noise ratio, S/N&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;3GHz&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt; 20). Survival analysis on these data combined with the VLA-COSMOS 1.4-GHz Joint Project catalog yields an expected median radio spectral index alpha = -0.7.

In their paper, the authors use X-ray, NUV-NIR and radio COSMOS data to investigate the population mix of this 90-cm radio sample, and find that the sample is dominated by active galactic nuclei. The average 90-20 cm spectral index (S_nu_~ nu&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;alpha&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, where S&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;nu&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; is the flux density at frequency nu and alpha the spectral index) of the 90-cm selected sources is -0.70, with an interquartile range from -0.90 to -0.53. Only a few ultra-steep-spectrum sources are present in this sample, consistent with results in the literature for similar fields. These data do not show clear steepening of the spectral index with redshift. Nevertheless, this sample suggests that sources with spectral indices steeper than -1 all lie at z &amp;amp;gt;~ 1, in agreement with the idea that ultra-steep-spectrum radio sources may trace intermediate-redshift galaxies (z &amp;amp;gt;~ 1). Using both the signal and rms maps (see Figs. 1 and 2 in the reference paper) as input data, the authors ran the AIPS task SAD to obtain a catalog of candidate components above a given local signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) threshold. The task SAD was run four times with search S/N levels of 10, 8, 6 and 5, using the resulting residual image each time. They recovered all the radio components with a local S/N &amp;amp;gt; 5.00. Subsequently, all the selected components were visually inspected, in order to check their reliability, especially for the components near strong side-lobes. After a careful analysis, a S/N threshold of 5.50 was adopted as the best compromise between a deep and a reliable catalog. The procedure yielded a total of 246 components with a local S/N &amp;amp;gt; 5.50. More than one component, identified in the 90-cm map sometimes belongs to a single radio source (e.g. large radio galaxies consist of multiple components). Using the 90-cm COSMOS radio map, the authors combined the various components into single sources based on visual inspection. The final catalog (contained in this HEASARC table) lists 182 radio sources, 30 of which have been classified as multiple, i.e. they are better described by more than a single component. Moreover, in order to ensure a more precise classification, all sources identified as multi-component sources have been also double-checked using the 20-cm radio map. The authors found that all the 26 multiple 90-cm radio sources within the 20-cm map have 20-cm counterpart sources already classified as multiple. The authors have made use of the VLA-COSMOS Large and Deep Projects over 2 square degrees, reaching down to an rms of ~15 microJy beam&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; ^ at 1.4 GHz and 1.5 arcsec resolution (Schinnerer et al. 2007, ApJS, 172, 46: the VLACOSMOS table in the HEASARC database). The 90-cm COSMOS radio catalog has, however, been extracted from a larger region of 3.14 square degrees (see Fig. 1 and Section 3.1 of the reference paper). This implies that a certain number of 90-cm sources (48) lie outside the area of the 20-cm COSMOS map used to select the radio catalog. Thus, to identify the 20-cm counterparts of the 90-cm radio sources, the authors used the joint VLA-COSMOS catalog (Schinnerer et al. 2010, ApJS, 188, 384: the VLACOSMJSC table in the HEASARC database) for the 134 sources within the 20-cm VLA-COSMOS area and the VLA- FIRST survey (White et al. 1997, ApJ, 475, 479: the FIRST table in the HEASARC database) for the remaining 48 sources. The 90-cm sources were cross-matched with the 20-cm VLA-COSMOS sources using a search radius of 2.5 arcseconds, while the cross-match with the VLA-FIRST sources has been done using a search radius of 4 arcseconds in order to take into account the larger synthesized beam of the VLA-FIRST survey of ~5 arcseconds. Finally, all the 90 cm - 20 cm associations were visually inspected in order to ensure also the association of the multiple 90-cm radio sources for which the value of the search radius used during the cross-match could be too restrictive. In summary, out of the total of 182 sources in the 90-cm catalog, 168 have counterparts at 20 cm.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=vlacos324m&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/vlacos324m.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The authors adopted a binomial no-source probability value, P&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;B&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt; 0.007 as the criterion to prune their initial candidate source list and generate a main source catalog, which includes 1,008 sources with a ~97% multiwavelength-identification rate.

The X-ray-selected AGN sample and associated photometric and spectroscopic optical follow-up are drawn from a subset of fields studied as part of the Serendipitous Extragalactic X-ray Source Identification (SEXSI) program. Mid-infrared data in these fields are derived from targeted and archival Spitzer imaging, and mid-infrared AGN selection is accomplished primarily through application of the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) color-color AGN &amp;amp;quot;wedge&amp;amp;quot; selection technique. Nearly all X-ray sources in these fields which exhibit clear spectroscopic signatures of AGN activity have mid-infrared colors consistent with IRAC AGN selection. These are predominantly the most luminous X-ray sources. X-ray sources that lack high-ionization and/or broad lines in their optical spectra are far less likely to be selected as AGNs by mid-infrared color selection techniques. The fraction of X-ray sources identified as AGN in the mid-infrared increases monotonically as the X-ray luminosity increases. Conversely, only 22% of mid-infrared-selected AGN are detected at X-ray energies in the moderately deep (t_exp_n~ 100 ks) SEXSI Chandra data. The authors have expanded the multi-wavelength data available for six SEXSI fields by obtaining Spitzer imaging observations. All six fields have deep Chandra X-ray images, optical imaging, and extensive, deep optical spectroscopy -- all of which has been published in Harrison et al. (2003, ApJ, 596, 944), Eckart et al. (2005, ApJS, 156, 35), and Eckart et al. (2006, ApJS, 165, 19).

This table contains mid-IR photometric data for 290 hard X-ray-selected SEXSI sources. Each of the four IRAC catalogs as well as the MIPS catalog was individually matched to the SEXSI X-ray source positions using a 2.5 arcseconds search radius. To calculate a false match rate, the authors shifted the X-ray source catalog by 1&apos; and matched to the IRAC and MIPS catalogs; this entire procedure was repeated 6 times using different 1&apos; shifts. The resulting false match rates were 10.1% (3.6 um), 7.2% (4.5 um), 3.7% (5.8 um), 2.6% (8.0 um), 1% (24 um), and &amp;amp;lt;1% for four-band-detected IRAC sources.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=chansexagn&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/chansexagn.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

It was operated from May 2009 till April 2013, offering unprecedented observational capabilities in the far-infrared and sub-millimeter spectral range (55-671 microns [um]). Herschel carried a 3.5m diameter passively cooled Cassegrain telescope, which was the largest of its kind and utilizes a novel silicon carbide technology. The science payload comprised three instruments: two direct detection cameras/medium resolution spectrometers, the Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS) and the Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE), and a very high-resolution heterodyne spectrometer, the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far Infrared or HIFI, whose focal plane units were housed inside a superfluid helium cryostat. PACS comprised two mutually exclusive sub-instruments: a bolometric camera designed to perform photometry in three spectral bands (70, 100 and 160 um) and an integral field unit grating spectrometer operating over the spectral range from 57 to 210 um with a spectral resolution ranging from 1000 to 5000. SPIRE comprised a three-band photometer, operating in spectral bands centered on 250, 350 and 500 um, and an imaging Fourier-Transform Spectrometer (FTS), which provided low resolution spectra over the 195-670 um band. Both instruments used germanium bolometers operating at 0.3 K and coupled to the telescope with hexagonally conical feedhorns. The photometer and the spectrometer were not designed to operate simultaneously. HIFI was designed to obtain spectra with very high resolution (up to 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;7&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;) in the far-infrared and sub-millimeter wavelengths not directly observable by ground-based telescopes. The HIFI instrument was an heterodyne receiver which provided spectroscopy in the continuous frequency range 480-1250 GHz (240-625 microns) and in the frequency range 1410-1910 GHz (157-213 microns). Herschel had two Announcement of Opportunities (AOs) for Open Time (OT) observations. The first in-flight AO for Open Time (OT1) was opened on 20 May 2010, with a deadline of 22 July 2010. For OT1, 241 observing programs were accepted and the total allocated observing time amounts to 6576.9 hours. The second in-flight AO for Open Time (OT2) was opened on 9 June 2011, with a deadline of 15 September 2011. There were parallel AOs for Guaranteed Time observations, GT1 and GT2, with separate deadlines. The Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for Herschel Key Programs (KP) was issued on 1 February 2007, with separate deadlines for guaranteed time (GT) and open time (OT) proposals. The whole Key Program AO process has now been completed, and by coincidence there were exactly the same number of KP GT and OT programs, in both cases 21 programs were awarded observing time. Taken together, these 42 observing programs contained 11,650 astronomical observation requests or AORs (AORs are the primary units of Herschel observing time and are effectively the Herschel &apos;observation units&apos;). The total allocated observing time for these programs was 11,257.7 hours, corresponding to approximately 57% of the nominally available Herschel routine mission science time.

XMM-Newton EPIC observations were made separately of the northern and southern portions of NGC 2264 on 2001 March 20 and 2002 March 17 - 18, respectively. Details concerning the two pointings are summarized in Table 1 of the reference paper. The nominal integration time was 42 ks for both observations. The three EPIC cameras were operated in full window mode. To prevent contamination of the X-ray images by the XUV and EUV emission of the optically and UV-bright sources in the field of view, the thick filter was used, which imposes a strong cut-off in the response at the lower energies. The X-ray data are merged with extant optical and near-infrared photometry, spectral classifications, H-alpha emission strengths, and rotation periods to examine the interrelationships between coronal and chromospheric activity, rotation, stellar mass, and internal structure for a statistically significant sample of pre-main-sequence stars. Out of the 316 distinct point-like sources that were detected at &amp;amp;gt;= 3-sigma levels in one or more of six EPIC images, a total of 300 distinct X-ray sources can be identified with optical or near-infrared counterparts. The sources are concentrated within three regions of the cluster: in the vicinity of S Mon, within the large emission/reflection nebulosity southwest of S Mon, and along the broad ridge of molecular gas that extends from the Cone Nebula to the NGC 2264 IRS 2 field. From the extinction-corrected color-magnitude diagram of the cluster, ages and masses for the optically identified X-ray sources are derived. A median age of ~ 2.5 Myr and an apparent age dispersion of ~ 5 Myr are suggested by pre-main-sequence evolutionary models. The X-ray luminosity of the detected sources appears well-correlated with bolometric luminosity, although there is considerable scatter in the relationship. Stellar mass contributes significantly to this dispersion, while isochronal age and rotation do not. X-ray luminosity and mass are well correlated such that L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ (M/M&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;solar&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;)&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;1.5&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, which is similar to the relationship found within the younger Orion Nebula Cluster. No strong evidence is found for a correlation between E(H-K), the near-infrared color excess, and the fractional X-ray luminosity, which suggests that optically thick dust disks have little direct influence on the observed X-ray activity levels. Among the X-ray-detected weak-line T Tauri stars, the fractional X-ray luminosity, L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;/L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;bol&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;, is moderately well correlated with the fractional H-alpha luminosity, L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;H(alpha)&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;/L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;bol&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;, but only at the 2-sigma level of significance. The cumulative distribution functions for the X-ray luminosities of the X-ray-detected classical and weak-line T Tauri stars within the cluster are comparable, assuming the demarcation between the two classes is at an H-alpha equivalent width of 10 Angstroms. However, if the non-detections in X-rays for the entire sample of H-alpha emitters known within the cluster are taken into account, then the cumulative distribution functions of these two groups are clearly different, such that classical T Tauri stars are underdetected by at least a factor of 2 relative to the weak-line T Tauri stars. Examining a small subsample of X-ray-detected stars that are probable accretors based on the presence of strong H-alpha emission and near-infrared excess, the authors conclude that definitive non-accretors are ~ 1.6 times more X-ray luminous than their accreting counterparts. In agreement with earlier published findings for the Orion Nebula Cluster, the authors find a slight positive correlation (valid at the 2-sigma confidence level) between L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;/L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;bol&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; and the rotation period in NGC 2264 stars. The lack of a strong anti-correlation between X-ray activity and rotation period in the stellar population of NGC 2264 suggests that either the deeply convective T Tauri stars are rotationally saturated or that the physical mechanism responsible for generating magnetic fields in pre-main-sequence stars is distinct from the one that operates in evolved main-sequence stars.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=ngc2264xmm&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/ngc2264xmm.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

A total of 300 main-catalog sources are new compared to the previous 2 Ms CDF-S main-catalog (the HEASARC CHANDFS2MS table) sources. The authors determined X-ray source positions using centroid and matched-filter techniques and obtained a median positional uncertainty of ~0.42 arcseconds. In their paper, they also provided a supplementary catalog (not included in this HEASARC table), which consists of 36 sources that are detected with wavdetect at a false-positive probability threshold of 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-5&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, satisfy the condition of 0.004 &amp;amp;lt; P &amp;amp;lt; 0.1, and have an optical counterpart with R &amp;amp;lt; 24. Multiwavelength identifications, basic optical/infrared/radio photometry, and spectroscopic/photometric redshifts are provided for the X-ray sources in the main and supplementary catalogs. Seven hundred sixteen (~97%) of the 740 main-catalog sources have multiwavelength counterparts, with 673 (~94% of 716) having either spectroscopic or photometric redshifts. The 740 main-catalog sources span broad ranges of full-band flux and 0.5-8 keV luminosity; the 300 new main-catalog sources span similar ranges although they tend to be systematically lower. Basic analyses of the X-ray and multiwavelength properties of the sources indicate that &amp;amp;gt;75% of the main-catalog sources are active galactic nuclei (AGNs); of the 300 new main-catalog sources, about 35% are likely normal and starburst galaxies, reflecting the rise of normal and starburst galaxies at the very faint flux levels uniquely accessible to the 4 Ms CDF-S. Near the center of the 4 Ms CDF-S (i.e., within an off-axis angle of 3&apos;), the observed AGN and galaxy source densities have reached 9800 (+1300,-1100) deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; and 6900 (+1100,-900) deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, respectively. Simulations show that the main catalog is highly reliable and is reasonably complete.

The 4 Ms CDF-S reaches on-axis flux limits of ~3.2 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-17&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, 9.1 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-18&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, and 5.5 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-17&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; for the full, soft, and hard bands, respectively. An increase in the CDF-S exposure time by a factor of ~2-2.5 would provide further significant gains and probe key unexplored discovery space.

Of the 6371 SDSS DR3 quasars covered by 204 GALEX GR1 tiles and listed in this table, 5380 (84%) have near-UV detections, while 3034 (48%) have both near-UV and far-UV detections using a matching radius of 7 arcseconds. Most of the DR3 sample quasars are detected in the near-UV until z ~ 1.7, with the near-UV detection fraction dropping to ~50% by z ~ 2. Statistical tests performed on the distributions of non-detections indicate that the optically selected quasars missed in the UV tend to be optically faint or at high redshift. The GALEX positions are shown to be consistent with the SDSS astrometry to within an rms scatter of 0.6 - 0.7 arcsecs in each coordinate, and the empirically determined photometric errors from multi-epoch GALEX observations significantly exceed the Poissonian errors quoted in the GR1 object catalogs. The UV-detected quasars are well separated from stars in UV-optical color-color space, with the UV-optical relative colors suggesting a marginally detected population of reddened objects due to absorption along the line of sight or dust associated with the quasar. The resulting spectral energy distributions (SEDs) cover ~350 - 9000 Angstroms (rest frame), where the overall median SED peaks near the Lyman-Alpha emission line, as found in other UV quasar studies. The large sample size allows the authors to construct median SEDs in small bins of redshift and luminosity, and they find that the median SED becomes harder (bluer) at UV wavelengths for quasars with lower continuum luminosity. The detected UV-optical flux as a function of redshift is qualitatively consistent with attenuation by intervening Lyman-absorbing clouds.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=glxsdssqso&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/glxsdssqso.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The resulting maps have a resolution of ~7 arcseconds and an rms noise limit of 60 microJy (uJy). To a 5-sigma detection limit of 300 uJy, the authors detect 223 sources within a survey area of 64 arcminutes in diameter. They compute the 610-MHz source counts and compare them to those measured at other radio wavelengths. The well-known flattening of the Eucidean-normalized 1.4-GHz source counts below ~ 2 mJy, usually explained by a population of starburst galaxies undergoing luminosity evolution, is seen at 610 MHz.

Observations were carried out in dual band, spectral line mode, the former to maximize bandwidth and the latter to minimize chromatic aberration. Two sidebands, each of 128 spectral channels of 125 kHz, were centred on 602 and 618 MHz to give a total of 32 MHz bandwidth, with two independent circular polarizations recorded. Sources were extracted with the AIPS task SAD. A conservative peak flux density detection limit of 5 sigma (i.e. 300 uJy) was used to minimize the number of noise spikes spuriously detected as sources. In the areas surrounding the five brightest sources, detection was performed separately with higher detection thresholds to account for the higher rms noise. Within the 20% power radius of the GMRT primary beam at 610 MHz (32 arcminutes), 213 sources were discovered above a 5-sigma peak flux density detection limit of 300 uJy. In order to determine the success of the SAD source extraction, both the science images and the residual noise maps were carefully inspected. There were eight extended sources where the Gaussian model fit by SAD inadequately described the data: these are marked by source_flag = &apos;a&apos; in this table. The characteristics of these sources were determined using the AIPS task TVSTAT, and contour plots of them are shown in Fig. 1 of the reference paper. Five of these appear to contain two peaks joined by extended emission, that is, they are double-lobe sources.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=gmrt1hxcsf&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/gmrt1hxcsf.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

In their first paper (Waldram et al. 2003, MNRAS, 342, 915), the authors described three regions of the survey, constituting a total area of 529 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; to a completeness limit of ~ 25 mJy. In this follow-up, they present results from a series of deeper regions, constituting a total area of 115 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; complete to ~ 10 mJy and of 29 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; complete to ~ 5.5 mJy. The authors have investigated the source counts and the distributions of the 1.4 to 15.2 GHz spectral indices for these deeper samples. The whole catalog of 643 sources is contained in the present table. Down to their lower limit of 5.5 mJy, the authors detect no evidence for any change in the differential source count from the earlier fitted count above 25 mJy, n(S) = 51(S/Jy)&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-2.15&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; Jy&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; sr&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;. They matched both their new and earlier catalogues with the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) catalogue at 1.4 GHz and selected flux-limited samples at both 15 and 1.4 GHz. As they expected, they found that the proportions of sources with flat and rising spectra in the samples selected at 15 GHz are significantly higher than those in the samples selected at 1.4 GHz. In addition, for 15-GHz samples selected in three flux density ranges, they detect a significant shift in the median value of the 1.4 to 15.2 GHz spectral index: the higher the flux densities, the higher the proportions of sources with flat and rising spectra. In the area complete to ~ 10 mJy, the authors find five sources between 10 and 15 mJy at 15 GHz, amounting to 4.3 per cent of sources in this range, with no counterpart in the NVSS catalogue. This implies that, had they relied on the NVSS for locating their sources, they could have missed a significant proportion of them at low flux densities. These results illustrate the problems inherent in using a low-frequency catalog to characterize the source population at a much higher frequency and emphasize the value of a blind 15.2-GHz survey.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=rt9cc15ghz&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/rt9cc15ghz.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The ASM was mounted 90 degrees from the spin axis; the satellite had a spin period of 6 seconds. The ASM operated from October 18, 1974 to March 10, 1980. The ASM instrument, built by the Lab for High Energy Astrophysics at NASA- Goddard Space Flight Center, provided continuous coverage of the entire sky, except for a 20 degree band straddling the satellite&apos;s equator. The ASM was intended to act as an early detection system for transients, and to monitor the variability of bright ( &amp;amp;gt; 0.2 Crab) galactic sources. The instrument consisted of a pair of X-ray pinhole cameras, each covering opposite halves of the sky, with gas-filled imaging proportional counters. Position determination of sources was accomplished through position-sensitive anode wires and satellite rotation. Each camera had a 1-cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; aperture. Overall telemetry constraints limited the duty cycle for any given source to 1 percent. With the low telemetry rate provided for this instrument (1 bit/s), temporal and spectral information were sacrificed for the sake of all-sky coverage.

The authors used the Chandra X-ray Observatory to study M 37 (NGC 2099), a 500-Myr-old open cluster that has been extensively surveyed for rotation periods (P&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;rot&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;). M 37 was observed almost continuously for five days, for a total of 440.5 ks, to measure stellar X-ray luminosities (L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;), a proxy for coronal activity, across a wide range of masses. The cluster&apos;s membership catalog was revisited to calculate updated membership probabilities from photometric data and each star&apos;s distance to the cluster center. The result is a comprehensive sample of 1699 M 37 members: 426 with P&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;rot&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;, 278 with X-ray detections, and 76 with both. The authors calculate Rossby numbers, R&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;o&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;= P&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;rot&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;/tau , where tau is the convective turnover time, and ratios of the X-ray-to-bolometric luminosity, L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;/L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;bol&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;, to minimize mass dependencies in their characterization of the rotation-coronal activity relation at 500 Myr. They find that fast rotators, for which R&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;o&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt; 0.09 +/- 0.01, show saturated levels of activity, with log(L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;/L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;bol&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;) = -3.06 +/- 0.04. For R&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;o&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt;= 0.09 +/- 0.01, activity is unsaturated and follows a power law of the form R&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;beta&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;o&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; , where beta = -2.03 (-0.14, +0.17). This is the largest sample available for analyzing the dependence of coronal emission on rotation for a single-aged population, covering stellar masses in the range 0.4 - 1.3 solar masses, P&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;rot&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; in the range 0.4 - 12.8 days, and L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; in the range 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;28.4&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; - 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;30.5&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;.

Each record is associated with a single observation that contains data from all instruments on board Swift. The BAT is the large field of view instrument and operates in the 10-300 keV energy band. The narrow field instruments, XRT and UVOT, operate in the X-ray and UV/optical regime, respectively. An observation is defined as a collection of snapshots, where a snapshot is defined as the time spent observing the same position continuously. Because of observing constraints, the length of a snapshot can be shorter than a single orbit and it can be interrupted because the satellite will point in a different direction of the sky or because the time allocated to that observation ends. The typical Swift observing strategy for a Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) and/or afterglow, consists of a serious of observations aimed at following the GRB and its afterglow evolution. This strategy is achieved with two different type of observations named Automatic Targets and Pre-Planned Targets. The Automatic Target is initiated on board soon after an event is triggered by the BAT. The Figure of Merit (FOM) algorithm, part of the observatory&apos;s autonomy, decides if it is worth requesting a slew maneuver to point the narrow field instruments (NFI) on Swift, XRT and UVOT, in the direction of the trigger. If the conditions to slew to the new position are satisfied, the Automatic Target observation takes place; all the instruments have a pre-set standard configuration of operating modes and filters and about 20000 seconds on source will be collected. The Pre-Planned Target observations instead are initiated from the ground once the trigger is known. These observations are planned on ground and uploaded onto the spacecraft.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=swiftmastr&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/swiftmastr.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

It lists 272 AGN for which they have secure optical identifications, precise optical spectroscopy and measured redshift values plus X-ray spectral information, i.e. 2-10 and 20-100 keV fluxes plus column densities. In their paper, the authors mainly use this sample to study the absorption properties of active galaxies, to probe new AGN classes and to test the AGN unification scheme. The authors find that half (48%) of the sample is absorbed, while the fraction of Compton-thick AGN is small (~7%). In line with their previous analysis, they have however shown that when the bias towards heavily absorbed objects which are lost if weak and at large distance is removed, as is possible in the local Universe, the above fractions increase to become 80% and 17%, respectively. The authors also find that absorption is a function of source luminosity, which implies some evolution in the obscuration properties of AGN. A few peculiar classes, so far poorly studied in the hard X-ray band, have been detected and studied for the first time such as 5 X-ray bright optically normal galaxies (XBONGs), 5 type 2 QSOs and 11 low-ionization nuclear emission regions. In terms of optical classification, this sample contains 57% type 1 and 43% type 2 AGN; this subdivision is similar to that found in X-rays if unabsorbed versus absorbed objects are considered, suggesting that the match between optical and X-ray classifications is on the whole good. Only a small percentage of sources (12%) does not fulfill the expectation of the unified theory as the authors find 22 type 1 AGN which are absorbed and 10 type 2 AGN which are unabsorbed. Studying in depth these outliers they found that most of the absorbed type 1 AGN have X-ray spectra characterized by either complex or warm/ionized absorption more likely due to ionized gas located in an accretion disc wind or in the bi-conical structure associated with the central nucleus, therefore unrelated to the toroidal structure. Among the 10 type 2 AGN which are unabsorbed, at most 3-4% are still eligible to be classified as &apos;true&apos; type 2 AGN. In the fourth INTEGRAL/IBIS survey (Bird et al. 2010, ApJS, 186, 1, available in the HEASARC database as the IBISCAT4 table), there are 234 objects which have been identified with AGN.

The authors&apos; initial WISE selection uses a slightly modified version of previously successful algorithms. They then select only the radio-loud sources using a measure of the radio-to-IR flux, the q&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;22&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; parameter, which is analogous to the q&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;24&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; parameter known in the literature but which instead uses the WISE band-four flux at 22 micron (um). Their final catalog contains 7,855 sources classified as BL Lacs, FSRQs, or mixed candidate blazars; 1,295 of these sources can be spatially re-associated as confirmed blazars.

The authors looked for correlations between properties of X-ray detected AGN and their far-infrared (FIR) detected host galaxies, to find quantitative evidences for this connection, highly debated in recent years. They exploit the rich multi-wavelength data set (from X-ray to FIR) that is available in the COSMOS field for a large sample (692 sources) of AGN and their hosts, in the redshift range 0.1 &amp;amp;lt; z &amp;amp;lt; 4, and use X-ray data to select AGN and determine their properties (intrinsic luminosity and nuclear obscuration), and broad-band (from UV to FIR) spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to derive host galaxy properties, viz., the stellar mass (M&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;*&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;) and the star formation rate (SFR). The authors find that the AGN 2-10 keV luminosity (L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;) and the host galaxy 8-1000 um star formation luminosity (L&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;SF&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;IR&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;) are significantly correlated.

In the reference paper, the authors also discuss the comparison between the distribution of these two quantities and the predictions from hydrodynamical simulations. Finally, they find that the average column density (N&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;H&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;) shows a positive correlation with the host M&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;*&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;, at all redshifts, but not with the SFR (or L&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;SF&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;IR&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;). This translates into a negative correlation with specific SFR.

The 300-ks observation reveals X-ray sources with luminosities (if at the 50 kpc distance of the LMC) down to 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;32&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, increasing the number of known point sources in the field by more than a factor of five. Among these detections are 13 massive stars (3 compact groups of massive stars, 9 O stars, and one early B star) with log(L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;/L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;BOL&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;) ~ -6.5 to -7, which may suggest that they are highly magnetic or colliding-wind systems. On the other hand, the stacked signal for regions corresponding to undetected O stars yields log(L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;X&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;/L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;BOL&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;) ~ -7.3, i.e., an emission level comparable to similar Galactic stars despite the lower metallicity. Other point sources coincide with 11 foreground stars, 6 late-B/A stars in N11, and many background objects. This observation also uncovers the extent and detailed spatial properties of the soft, diffuse emission regions, but the presence of some hotter plasma in their spectra suggests contamination by the unresolved stellar population. The Chandra ACIS-I observations of N11 were made in six separate segments within two months in 2007. As summarized in Table 1, the exposure time of each segment was 42-49 ks and the roll angle ranged from 130 to 188 degrees Cleaning of significant background flares, together with a correction for the dead time of the six observations, resulted in a total of 280 ks useful exposure for the subsequent analysis. A combination of source detection algorithms (wavelet, sliding-box, and maximum likelihood centroid fitting) were applied to unsmoothed data in three bands: soft (S): 0.5-2.0 keV, hard (H): 2-8 keV, and total (T): 0.5-8 keV. The final source list contains 165 sources with local false detection probability P &amp;amp;lt; 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-6&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; in at least one band (Poisson statistics were used in calculating the significance of a source detection above the local count background). The source detection, though optimized for point-like sources, includes a few strong peaks of diffuse X-ray emission, chiefly associated with the SNR N11L, which lies about ~7&apos; west of the field center. The authors calculated the net (background-subtracted) count rates in four sub-bands (S1 = 0.5-1.0 keV, S2 = 1-2 keV, H1 = 2-4 keV and H2 = 4-8 keV, which were later added to form the count rates in the broader bands (S, H, and T). Source counts for each sub-band were then extracted within the 70% energy-encircled radius (EER) of the PSF, whose size depends on the off-axis angle of the source in the exposure and of the energy band under consideration. A background correction was also applied. Finally, count rates were derived by dividing source net counts by their effective exposure times (values at the source positions in the exposure map of the energy band under consideration), leading to equivalent on-axis values. It should be noted that the presented count rates have thus been corrected for the full PSF and for the effective exposure, which accounts not only for the telescope vignetting, but also for the degradation of the detector sensitivity over time. Therefore, the actual number of counts in a detection aperture is not simply a count rate multiplied by an exposure of 280 ks. The difference could be up to a factor of ~2, depending on a source&apos;s spectral shape. The authors searched for counterparts to their X-ray sources in several catalogs: the USNO-B1.0 Catalog (Monet et al. 2003), the Guide Star Catalog V2.3.2 (GSC, Lasker et al. 2008), the 2MASS All-Sky Catalog of Point Sources (Cutri et al. 2003), the Magellanic Clouds Photometric Survey (MCPS; Zaritsky et al. 2004, AJ, 128, 1606), the IRSF Magellanic Clouds Point Source Catalog (Kato et al. 2007, PASJ, 59, 615)), the DENIS Catalogue toward Magellanic Clouds (DCMC; Cioni et al. 2000, A&amp;amp;amp;AS, 144, 235), and JHK&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;s&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; photometry of N11 young stellar objects ([HKN2006]; Hatano et al. 2006, AJ, 132, 2653). A best correlation radius of 1&amp;amp;quot; was found to be optimal and was thus used to derive the final list of optical and infrared counterparts to the Chandra X-ray sources: 71 of the 165 sources have at least one counterpart within 1&amp;amp;quot;. The HEASARC has modified the counterpart names given in this table compared to those given in the reference paper so that they comply with the forms recommended by the CDS Dictionary of Nomenclature of Celestial Objects.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=lmcn11cxo&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/lmcn11cxo.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) as part of the Gould&apos;s Belt Survey (GBS) program. The authors detected 374 and 354 sources at 4.5 and 7.5 GHz, respectively. Of these, 148 are associated with previously known young stellar objects (YSOs). Another 86 sources previously unclassified at either optical or infrared wavelengths exhibit radio properties that are consistent with those of young stars. The overall properties of these sources at radio wavelengths such as their variability and radio to X-ray luminosity relation are consistent with previous results from the GBS. These detections provide target lists for follow-up Very Long Baseline Array radio observations to determine their distances, as YSOs are located in regions of high nebulosity and extinction, making it difficult to measure their optical parallaxes. The observations were obtained with the JVLA of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) in its A configuration. The observations of the 210 fields in the Orion Molecular Clouds A and B were obtained in three different epochs (2011 June 25 to July 4, July 23 to 30, and August 25 to 29, as described in Table 1 of the reference paper) typically separated from one another by a month. The 210 individual fields have been split into 7 maps, with 30 fields being observed per map, as follows: 12 in the lambda Ori region, 3 in L1622, 27 are shared between NGC 2068 and NGC 2071, 14 are shared between NGC 2023 and NGC 2024, 11 in the sigma Ori region, 109 in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), 16 in L1641-N, 8 in L1641-C, and 10 in L1641-S (see Figures 1 to 7 in the reference paper). Two frequency sub-bands, each 1-GHz wide, and centered at 4.5 and 7.5 GHz, respectively, were recorded simultaneously. The authors achieved a nearly uniform rms noise of 60 microJy beam&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; at both frequencies in all the regions. The only exception to this is in the Trapezium region due to nebular emission; there the noise was 200 microJy beam&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; after excluding baselines smaller than 150 kilo-lambda during imaging to remove extended emission. Sources were identified through a visual inspection of the individual fields at 4.5 GHz during the cleaning and imaging process since an automated source identification was deemed to be not sufficiently advanced and produced results that were too unreliable. In particularly clustered regions such as the Trapezium and NGC 2024, in addition to standard imaging, data from all three epochs were combined into a single image for source identification purposes only to improve statistical significance of each detection. The authors detected a combined total of 374 sources among the three epochs for all of the regions. All sources but one had fluxes greater than five times the rms noise in at least one epoch. The remaining source, &apos;GBS-VLA J053518.67-052033.1&apos;, was detected at two epochs with maximum detection probability of 4.9 sigma in a single epoch data. It is found in the Trapezium region, and has known counterparts in other wavelength regimes. The authors cross-referenced their catalog of sources with previous major radio, infrared, optical and X-ray surveys of the regions published in the literature. They have generally considered sources in these surveys to be counterparts if they had positional coincidences less than 1 arcsecond, but have allowed for larger offsets if the combined uncertainty between the databases was large. Of 374 detected sources, 261 have been previously found at another wavelength region, while 113 are new detections. 146 sources have been detected in X-rays, 94 at optical wavelengths, 218 at infrared, and 63 in previous radio surveys. Of the previously identified sources, 1 is extragalactic, while the other 148 as young stellar objects (YSOs). Of the YSOs, 106 have been placed on the standard class system based on the IRAC color-color classification of Allen et al. (2004, ApJS, 154, 363). There are 11 Class 0/I, 26 Class II, and 70 Class III type stars. A total of 225 sources are either new detections or, to the authors&apos; knowledge, have not been previously classified in the literature. Of these remaining objects, they have identified 86 as exhibiting variability or high levels of circular polarization. While the authors cannot exclude the possibility that any of them are extragalactic in nature, quasars are not expected to vary as strongly on timescales of few weeks to few months, and exhibit very weak circular polarization, so these sources (listed in Table 5 of the reference paper) are likely YSO candidates. Using the same criteria of variability and circular polarization would identify only 107 of the 148 previously-known YSOs; thus we cannot tell which of the remaining 139 unidentified sources are YSOs or extragalactic objects.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=vlagbsori&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/vlagbsori.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The sample was selected from the complete set of 2704 BATSE GRBs based on their energy fluence or peak photon flux values in order to assure good statistics, and included 17 short GRBs. To obtain well-constrained spectral parameters, several photon models were used to fit each spectrum. Spectral parameters resulting from the fits using different models were compared, and the spectral parameters that best represent each spectrum were statistically determined, taking into account the parametrization differences among the models. A thorough analysis was performed on 350 time-integrated and 8459 time-resolved burst spectra, and the effects of integration times in determining the spectral parameters were explored. Using the results, correlations among spectral parameters and their evolution pattern within each burst were studied. The resulting spectral catalog provides reliable constraints on particle acceleration and emission mechanisms in GRBs, and is the most comprehensive study of spectral properties of GRB prompt emission to date.

Not all triggers pass the acceptance tests, so not all trigger numbers are present. For each trigger, there is an associated set of FITS data files that represent the raw data sources and some higher level data products. Spectral (SD) data are prefixed with an &apos;s&apos; (e.g. &apos;sher&apos;). Not all data types are available for all triggers due to instrument mode differences. Available data taken prior to the trigger may contain the beginning of the triggering event before it satisfied the triggering criteria. Background-type files can be used to remove background signal levels from the triggered period. The BFITS data files - containing burst and background spectral data as a function of time - and the detector response matrices (DRM) - modeling the instrument response to account for scattering and other effects - are extremely useful for gamma-ray burst analysis. Also, the BFITS and DRM files can be converted to PHA-II and RMF format for analysis with XSPEC using available FTOOLS.

The Survey lists accurate positions with internal errors of about an arcsecond, flux densities (which for strong point sources have internal errors of about 1% and total errors of about 5%), simple structure models and indications of spectrum and variability for 66841 sources. Results of comparisons with other data show that the Survey is 90% complete at 0.4 Jy and 80% complete at 0.25 Jy, is nearly free from spurious sources, and has a lobeshift incidence which is reasonably described by quality flags associated with each source. The University of Texas Radio Astronomy Observatory (UTRAO) carried out, with the Texas Interferometer, this 365 MHz survey of the sky, which was intended to be complete to a flux density level of 0.25 Jy, to provide positions with an accuracy of about 1 arcsec in both coordinates, to give accurate flux densities and indication of source variability, and to give rough structure models for each source. The observations began in 1974 and were completed in 1983. A preliminary version of one declination strip was published (Douglas et al., Publ. Dept. Astron. Univ.

Most were detected statistically on the NVSS images with median peak flux densities S&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;p&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; of ~ 0.3 mJy/beam and ~ 0.05 mJy/beam in the low- and high-redshift samples, corresponding to spectral luminosities log L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;1.4GHz&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ 22.7 and ~ 24.1 W/Hz, respectively. The authors suggest that the faint radio sources are powered by star formation at rates dM/dt of ~ 20 M_{sun}_/yr in the moderate luminosity (median M&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;i&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; of ~ -23.4) low-redshift QSOs and dM/dt ~ 500M&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;sun&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;/yr in the very luminous (median M&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;i&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ -27.5) high-redshift QSOs. Such luminous starbursts (&amp;amp;lt;log(L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;IR&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;/L&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;sun&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;)&amp;amp;gt; ~ 11.2 and ~ 12.6, respectively) are consistent with &amp;amp;quot;quasar mode&amp;amp;quot; accretion in which cold gas flows fuel both AGN and starburst. The SDSS DR7 QSO catalog (Schneider et al. 2010, AJ, 139, 2360) is complete to i = 19.1 mag over a solid angle of 2.66 sr around the North Galactic Pole. It contains the small sample of 179 color-selected QSOs defined by M&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;i&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt; -23 in the narrow redshift range 0.2 &amp;amp;lt; z &amp;amp;lt; 0.3 studied by Kimball et al. (2011, ApJ, 739, L29) and the larger sample of 1,313 QSOs in the wider redshift range 0.2 &amp;amp;lt; z &amp;amp;lt; 0.45 discussed here. Note that these magnitudes were calculated for an H&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;0&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;= 71 km/s/Mpc and Omega&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;M&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; = 0.27 modern flat LambdaCDM cosmology. The entire SDSS DR7 area is covered by the NVSS, whose source catalog is complete for statistical purposes above a peak flux density S&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;p&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ~ 2.4 mJy/beam at 1.4 GHz. In the redshift range 0.2 &amp;amp;lt; z &amp;amp;lt; 0.45 the 45&amp;amp;quot; FWHM (full width between half-maximum points) beam of the NVSS spans 150 - 250 kpc. There are 163 (12%) NVSS detections of the 1,313 QSOs in the redshift range 0.2 &amp;amp;lt; z &amp;amp;lt; 0.45 which are listed in Table 1 of the reference paper.

The NVSS detected radio emission stronger than S = 2.4 mJy from only 191 (8%) of them: these are listed in Table 3 of the reference paper. This HEASARC table contains the contents of both samples described above. It thus has 163 + 191 = 354 entries, the sum of Tables 1 and 3 from the reference paper.

       "<tr><td>906</td><td>radio</td><td>PACOFSCAT</td><td>ivo://nasa.heasarc/pacofscat</td><td>The Planck-ATCA Co-eval Observations (PACO) project collected data between 4.5 and 40 GHz for 482 sources selected within the Australia Telescope 20-GHz (AT20G) catalog and observed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). Observations were done almost simultaneously with the Planck satellite, in the period between 2009 July and 2010 August. In this paper, the authors present and discuss the data for the complete sample of 159 sources with AT20G flux densities &amp;amp;gt; 200 mJy in the South Ecliptic Pole (SEP) region. The Planck Early Release Compact Source Catalogue (ERCSC) contains 57 of their sources. A comparison between the PACO catalog and the ERCSC confirms that the reliability of the latter is better than 95%. The missing ERCSC sources are typically associated with the Large Magellanic Cloud, the Milky Way or are otherwise extended. The spectral analysis of the PACO faint catalog shows a spectral steepening of the sources at high frequencies, confirming the results obtained from the PACO bright sample (the HEASARC PACOBSCAT table). A comparison with AT20G measurements, carried out, on average, a few years earlier, has demonstrated that, on these time-scales, these sources show a rather high variability with an rms amplitude of approximately 40% at 20 GHz. The source spectral properties are found not to vary substantially with flux density, except for an increase in the fraction of steep spectrum sources at fainter flux densities. These data also allow the authors to extend by a factor of ~ 5 downwards in flux density the source counts at ~ 33 and ~ 40 GHz obtained from the ERCSC. This allows the authors to substantially improve their control on the contribution of unresolved extragalactic sources to the power spectrum of small-scale fluctuations in cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps. The PACO faint sample, presented in this paper, is made up of 159 sources with 20-GHz flux densities &amp;amp;gt;= 200 mJy in the SEP region (ecliptic latitude &amp;amp;lt; -75 degrees) and with 3h &amp;amp;lt; RA &amp;amp;lt; 9h, Dec. &amp;amp;lt; -30 degrees. Near the Ecliptic Poles, Planck&apos;s scan circles intersect. Therefore, the area is covered many times, and Planck&apos;s sensitivity is maximal in these regions. A full description of the PACO project and of its main goals is given in Massardi et al. (2011, MNRAS, 415, 1597). The aims specific to the PACO faint sample are as follows: (i) Extend to fainter flux densities the characterization of radio source spectra from 4.5 GHz to the Planck frequency range; (ii) Extend the determination of source counts at ~ 33 and ~ 40 GHz obtained from the analysis of the ERCSC downwards in flux density by a factor of ~ 5. Going down in flux density is important to control the contamination of CMB maps by faint radio sources. This table contains the catalog of 674 observations of 152 of the 159 sources that comprise the &apos;faint PACO sample&apos;. Thus, each row in this table corresponds to a specific observation of a source, and there can be several rows for any source, corresponding to different observations. The ATCA observations were made in 6 2-GHz wide observing bands: 4732 - 6780 MHz, 8232 - 10280 MHz, 17232 - 19280 MHz, 23232 - 25280 MHz, 32232 - 34280 MHz and 38232 - 40280 MHz. In order to properly define the detailed source spectral behavior, the authors have split each 2-GHz band into 4 x 512 MHz sub-bands, and calibrated each sub-band independently. Thus, for each observation, the flux density at 24 frequencies is given. The frequency identifier in the flux density appears (at least to this HEASARC scientist) to be the lower frequency of the sub-band rather than its central frequency. In order to provide the easiest way to extrapolate the observed counts or model predictions from one frequency to another, the authors have modeled the observed source spectra. As their observations covered a wide frequency range from 4.5 to 40 GHz over which a single power law is not enough to describe the spectral behavior of the sources, they studied the spectra of the 174 point-like sources in this sample by fitting the observed data with a double power law of the form S&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;nu&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; = S&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;0&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;/[(nu/nu&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;0&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;)&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-a&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; + (nu/nu&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;0&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;)&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-b&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;], where nu is the frequency, S&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;nu&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; is the flux density in Jy, and S&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;0&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;, nu&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;0&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;, a and b are free parameters. The authors considered only those sources for which they had at least four data points for each of the 2 x 2 GHz bands considered. When observations at more than one epoch were available, the authors chose the one with the greatest number of data points. Full details of the fitting procedure are given in Section 3.1 of Massardi et al. (2011, MNRAS, 415, 1597) and Section 4 of the reference paper.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=pacofscat&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/pacofscat.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

It was the third generation of space-based cosmic microwave background experiments, after the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) and the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). Planck was launched on 14 May 2009 on an Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana. Following a cruise to the Earth-Sun L2 Lagrange point, cooling and in orbit checkout, Planck initiated the First Light Survey on 12 August 2009. Planck then continuously measured the intensity of the sky over a range of frequencies from 30 to 857 GHz (wavelengths of 1 cm to 350 micron) with spatial resolutions ranging from about 33 to 5 arcminutes, respectively. The Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) on Planck provided temperature and polarization information using radiometers which operated between 30 and 70 GHz. The High Frequency Instrument (HFI) used pairs of polarization-sensitive bolometers at each of four frequencies between 100 and 353 GHz but did not measure polarization information in the two upper HFI bands at 545 and 857 GHz. The lowest Planck frequencies overlapped with WMAP, and the highest frequencies extended far into the submillimeter in order to improve separation between Galactic foregrounds and the cosmic microwave background (CMB). By extending to wavelengths longer than those at which the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) operated, Planck provided an unprecedented window into dust emission at far-infrared and submillimeter wavelengths. The Second Planck Catalogue of Compact Sources is a list of discrete objects detected in single-frequency maps from the full duration of the Planck mission and supersedes previous versions. It consists of compact sources, both Galactic and extragalactic, detected over the entire sky. Compact sources detected in the lower frequency channels are assigned to the PCCS2, while at higher frequencies they are assigned to one of two subcatalogs, the PCCS2 or PCCS2E, depending on their location on the sky. The first of these (PCCS2) covers most of the sky and allows the user to produce subsamples at higher reliabilities than the target 80% integral reliability of the catalog. The second (PCCS2E) contains sources detected in sky regions where the diffuse emission makes it difficult to quantify the reliability of the detections. Both the PCCS2 and PCCS2E include polarization measurements, in the form of polarized flux densities, or upper limits, and orientation angles for all seven polarization-sensitive Planck channels. The improved data-processing of the full-mission maps and their reduced noise levels allow the authors to increase the number of objects in the catalog, improving its completeness for the target 80% reliability as compared with the previous versions, the PCCS and the Early Release Compact Source Catalogue (ERCSC). The Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) Data Processing Center (DPC) produced the 30, 44, and 70 GHz maps after the completion of eight full surveys (spanning the period from 12 August 2009 to 3 August 2013). In addition, special LFI maps covering the period 1 April 2013 to 30 June 2013 were produced in order to compare the Planck flux-density scales with those of the Very Large Array and the Australia Telescope Compact Array, by performing simultaneous observations of a sample of sources over that period. The High Frequency Instrument (HFI) DPC produced the 100-, 143-, 217-, 353-, 545-, and 857-GHz maps after five full surveys (from 2009 August 12 to 2012 January 11). As in the PCCS, the PCCS2 provides four different measures of the flux density for each source. They are determined by the source detection algorithm (DETFLUX), aperture photometry (APERFLUX), point spread function fitting (PSFFLUX), and Gaussian fitting (GAUFLUX). Only the first is obtained from the filtered maps; the other measures are estimated from the full-sky maps at the positions of the sources. The source detection algorithm photometry, the aperture photometry, and the point spread function (PSF) fitting use the Planck band-average effective beams, calculated with FEBeCoP (Fast Effective Beam Convolution in Pixel space). Note that only the PSF fitting algorithm takes into account the variation of the PSF with position on the sky. The PCCS2 has been produced from the Planck full-mission maps (eight sky surveys in the LFI and five sky surveys in the HFI), and therefore supersedes the previous catalogs (for the PCCS only 1.5 surveys were analyzed). It also includes the latest calibration and beam information, and the authors have improved some of the algorithms used to measure the photometry of the sources.

One of the primary differences of this release of the PCCS from previous releases is the division of the six highest frequency catalogs into two subcatalogs, the PCCS2 and the PCCS2E.

It was the third generation of space-based cosmic microwave background experiments, after the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) and the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). Planck was launched on 14 May 2009 on an Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana. Following a cruise to the Earth-Sun L2 Lagrange point, cooling and in orbit checkout, Planck initiated the First Light Survey on 12 August 2009. Planck then continuously measured the intensity of the sky over a range of frequencies from 30 to 857 GHz (wavelengths of 1 cm to 350 micron) with spatial resolutions ranging from about 33 to 5 arcminutes, respectively. The Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) on Planck provided temperature and polarization information using radiometers which operated between 30 and 70 GHz. The High Frequency Instrument (HFI) used pairs of polarization-sensitive bolometers at each of four frequencies between 100 and 353 GHz but did not measure polarization information in the two upper HFI bands at 545 and 857 GHz. The lowest Planck frequencies overlapped with WMAP, and the highest frequencies extended far into the submillimeter in order to improve separation between Galactic foregrounds and the cosmic microwave background (CMB). By extending to wavelengths longer than those at which the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) operated, Planck provided an unprecedented window into dust emission at far-infrared and submillimeter wavelengths. The Second Planck Catalogue of Compact Sources is a list of discrete objects detected in single-frequency maps from the full duration of the Planck mission and supersedes previous versions. It consists of compact sources, both Galactic and extragalactic, detected over the entire sky. Compact sources detected in the lower frequency channels are assigned to the PCCS2, while at higher frequencies they are assigned to one of two subcatalogs, the PCCS2 or PCCS2E, depending on their location on the sky. The first of these (PCCS2) covers most of the sky and allows the user to produce subsamples at higher reliabilities than the target 80% integral reliability of the catalog. The second (PCCS2E) contains sources detected in sky regions where the diffuse emission makes it difficult to quantify the reliability of the detections. Both the PCCS2 and PCCS2E include polarization measurements, in the form of polarized flux densities, or upper limits, and orientation angles for all seven polarization-sensitive Planck channels. The improved data-processing of the full-mission maps and their reduced noise levels allow the authors to increase the number of objects in the catalog, improving its completeness for the target 80% reliability as compared with the previous versions, the PCCS and the Early Release Compact Source Catalogue (ERCSC). The Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) Data Processing Center (DPC) produced the 30, 44, and 70 GHz maps after the completion of eight full surveys (spanning the period from 12 August 2009 to 3 August 2013). In addition, special LFI maps covering the period 1 April 2013 to 30 June 2013 were produced in order to compare the Planck flux-density scales with those of the Very Large Array and the Australia Telescope Compact Array, by performing simultaneous observations of a sample of sources over that period. The High Frequency Instrument (HFI) DPC produced the 100-, 143-, 217-, 353-, 545-, and 857-GHz maps after five full surveys (from 2009 August 12 to 2012 January 11). As in the PCCS, the PCCS2 provides four different measures of the flux density for each source. They are determined by the source detection algorithm (DETFLUX), aperture photometry (APERFLUX), point spread function fitting (PSFFLUX), and Gaussian fitting (GAUFLUX). Only the first is obtained from the filtered maps; the other measures are estimated from the full-sky maps at the positions of the sources. The source detection algorithm photometry, the aperture photometry, and the point spread function (PSF) fitting use the Planck band-average effective beams, calculated with FEBeCoP (Fast Effective Beam Convolution in Pixel space). Note that only the PSF fitting algorithm takes into account the variation of the PSF with position on the sky. The PCCS2 has been produced from the Planck full-mission maps (eight sky surveys in the LFI and five sky surveys in the HFI), and therefore supersedes the previous catalogs (for the PCCS only 1.5 surveys were analyzed). It also includes the latest calibration and beam information, and the authors have improved some of the algorithms used to measure the photometry of the sources. This table contains the PCCS2 subsample of the PCCS Public Release 2 table of sources detected at 143 GHz.

The detected sources have a median position uncertainty of 1.3 arcseconds (1 sigma) and limiting fluxes down to ~1 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-14&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg/s/cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; in the 0.2-4.5 keV band, corresponding to X-ray luminosities of ~5 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;33&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg/s for sources located in the SMC. Sources have been classified using X-ray hardness ratios, X-ray variability, and their multi-wavelength properties. In their paper, the authors discuss the statistical properties of the detected X-ray sources, like the spatial distribution, X-ray color diagrams, luminosity functions, and time variability. They have identified 49 SMC high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXB), four super-soft X-ray sources (SSS), 34 foreground stars, and 72 active galactic nuclei (AGN) behind the SMC. In addition, they found candidates for SMC HMXBs (45) and faint SSSs (8) as well as AGN (2092) and galaxy clusters (13). Notice that X-ray sources with high extent (&amp;amp;gt;40 arcseconds), e.g. supernova remnants and galaxy clusters, have been previously presented by Haberl et al. (2012, A&amp;amp;amp;A, 545, A128) and are not included in this table. To investigate the spectral behavior of all sources, the authors used hardness ratios HR&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;i&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; (i = 1, 2, 3, 4), defined by HR&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;i&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; = (R&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;i+1&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; - R&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;i&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;)/(R&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;i+1&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; + R&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;i&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;), where R&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;i&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; is the count rate in energy band i as defined by: &amp;amp;lt;pre&amp;amp;gt; Band Energy Range 1 0.2-0.5 keV 2 0.5-1.0 keV 3 1.0-2.0 keV 4 2.0-4.5 keV 5 4.5-12. keV &amp;amp;lt;/pre&amp;amp;gt; To increase statistics, the authors also calculated average HR_i&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;s&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;, combining all available instruments and observations.

A.3 of the reference paper. For the calculation, they assumed a universal spectrum for all sources, described by a power-law model with a photon index of 1.7 and a photo-electric foreground absorption by the Galaxy of N&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;H,Gal&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; = 6 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;20&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; (average for the SMC main field in the H I map of Dickey &amp;amp;amp; Lockman 1990, ARAA, 28, 215). In addition to the fluxes for each detection, the authors calculated flux upper limits F&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;UL&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; for each observation and source, if the source was observed but not detected in an individual observation. As for the initial source detection, they used the emldetect task to fit sources, but kept the source positions fixed at the master positions and accepted all detection likelihoods in order to get an upper limit for the flux.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=smcpscxmm&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/smcpscxmm.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The catalog also includes previously known quasars (mostly from SDSS-I and II) that were re-observed by BOSS.

The authors have used a simple scheme to disentangle SFGs, radio-quiet (RQ), and radio-loud (RL) AGNs based on the combination of radio data with Chandra X-ray data and mid-infrared observations from Spitzer. They find that at flux densities between about 30 and 100 uJy, the radio population is dominated by SFGs (~60%) and that RQ AGNs become increasingly important over RL ones below 100 uJy. In the paper, the authors also compare the host galaxy properties of the three classes in terms of morphology, optical colors and stellar masses. Their results show that both SFG and RQ AGN host galaxies have blue colors and late-type morphology while RL AGNs tend to be hosted by massive red galaxies with early-type morphology. This supports the hypothesis that radio emission in SFGs and RQ AGNs mainly comes from the same physical process: star formation in the host galaxy.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=vlaecdfscls&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/vlaecdfscls.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

The reference paper focuses on the identification of their optical and infrared (IR) counterparts. The authors use a likelihood-ratio technique that is particularly useful when dealing with deep optical images to minimize the number of spurious associations. They find a reliable counterpart for 95% of their radio sources. Most of the counterparts (74%) are detected at optical wavelengths, but there is a significant fraction (21%) that are only detectable in the IR. Combining newly acquired optical spectra with data from the literature, the authors are able to assign a redshift to 81% of the identified radio sources (37% spectroscopic). They also investigate the X-ray properties of the radio sources using the Chandra 4 Ms and 250 ks observations. In particular, the authors use a stacking technique to derive the average properties of radio objects undetected in the Chandra images. The results of their analysis are collected in this new catalog containing the position of the optical/IR counterpart, the redshift information, and the X-ray fluxes. It is the deepest multi-wavelength catalog of radio sources, which will be used for future study of this galaxy population. The E-CDFS was observed at 1.4 GHz with the VLA between 2007 June and September (Miller et al. 2008, ApJS, 179, 114). The mosaic image covered an area of about 34 by 34 arcminutes with near-uniform sensitivity. The typical rms is 7.4 microJy for a 2.8 by 1.6 arcseconds beam. The second data release (N. Miller et al. 2012, in preparation) provides a new source catalog with a 5-sigma point-source detection limit, for a total of 883 sources. The median value of the distribution is 58.5 microJy and the median signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is 7.6.

As usual in surveys based on a relatively small number of overlapping VLA pointings, the flux limit varies over the area surveyed: from a 5-sigma limit of 0.135 mJy over an area of 0.12 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; to 1.15 mJy or better over the whole region covered of 4.22 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;.

These regions of the sky have previously been surveyed to shallower flux limits at 20 cm with the VLA as part of the VLA D-configuration NVSS (full width at half-maximum, FWHM = 45arcseconds) and VLA-B configuration FIRST (FWHM = 5 arcseconds) surveys. This whole survey has a nominal 5-sigma flux limit a factor of 2 below that of the NVSS; 3.4 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; of the survey reaches the nominal flux limit of the FIRST survey and 1.5 deg&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; reaches 0.25 mJy, a factor of 4 below the nominal FIRST survey limit. In addition, this survey is at a resolution intermediate between the two surveys and thus is well suited for a comparison of the reliability and resolution-dependent surface brightness effects that affect interferometric radio surveys. The authors have carried out a detailed comparison of their survey and these two independent surveys in order to assess the reliability and completeness of each.

The WMAP 9-Year CMB-Free Point Source Catalog contained herein has information on 502 point sources in three frequency bands (41, 61 and 94 GHz, also known as the Q, V, and W bands, respectively) based on data from the entire 9 years of the WMAP sky survey from 10 Aug 2001 0:00 UT to 10 Aug 2010 0:00 UT, inclusive. The CMB-free method of point source identification was originally applied to one-year and three-year V- and W-band maps by Chen &amp;amp;amp; Wright (2008, ApJ, 681, 747) and to five-year V- and W-band maps by Wright et al. (2009, ApJS, 180, 283). The method used here is that applied to five-year Q-, V-, and W-band maps by Chen &amp;amp;amp; Wright (2009, ApJ, 694, 222) and to seven-year Q-, V-, and W-band maps by Gold et al. (2011, ApJS, 192, 15). The V- and W-band maps are smoothed to Q-band resolution. An internal linear combination (ILC) map (see Section 5.3.3 of the reference paper) is then formed from the three maps using weights such that CMB fluctuations are removed, flat-spectrum point sources are retained with fluxes normalized to Q-band, and the variance of the ILC map is minimized. The ILC map is filtered to reduce noise and suppress large angular scale structure. Peaks in the filtered map that are &amp;amp;gt; 5 sigma and outside of the nine-year point source catalog mask are identified as point sources, and source positions are obtained by fitting the beam profile plus a baseline to the filtered map for each source. For the nine- year analysis, the position of the brightest pixel is adopted instead of the fit position in rare instances where they differ by &amp;amp;gt; 0.1 degrees. Source fluxes are estimated by integrating the Q, V, and W temperature maps within 1.25 degrees of each source position, with a weighting function to enhance the contrast of the point source relative to background fluctuations, and applying a correction for Eddington bias due to noise (sometimes called &amp;amp;quot;deboosting&amp;amp;quot;). The authors identify possible 5-GHz counterparts to the WMAP sources found by cross-correlating with the GB6 (Gregory et al. 1996, ApJS, 103, 427), PMN (Griffith et al. 1994, ApJS, 90, 179; Griffith et al. 1995, ApJS, 97, 347; Wright et al. 1994, ApJS, 94, 111; Wright et al. 1996, ApJS, 103, 145), Kuehr et al. (1981, A&amp;amp;amp;AS, 45, 367), and Healey et al. (2009, AJ, 138, 1032) catalogs. A 5-GHz source is identified as a counterpart if it lies within 11 arcminutes of the WMAP source position (the mean WMAP source position uncertainty is 4 arcminutes). When two or more 5 GHz sources are within 11 arcminutes, the brightest is assumed to be the counterpart and a multiple identification flag is entered in the catalog. A separate 9-year Point Source Catalog (available in Browse as the &amp;amp;lt;a href=&quot;/W3Browse/wmap/wmapptsrc.html&quot;&amp;amp;gt;WMAPPTSRC&amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;gt; table) has information on 501 point sources in five frequency bands from 23 to 94 GHz that were found using an alternative method. The two catalogs have 387 sources in common. As noted by Gold et al. (2011, ApJS, 192, 15), differences in the source populations detected by the two search methods are largely caused by Eddington bias in the five-band source detections due to CMB fluctuations and noise. At low flux levels, the five-band method tends to detect point sources located on positive CMB fluctuations and to overestimate their fluxes, and it tends to miss sources located in negative CMB fluctuations. Other point source detection methods have been applied to WMAP data and have identified sources not found by our methods (e.g., Scodeller et al. (2012, ApJ, 753, 27); Lanz (2012, ADASS 7); Ramos et al. (2011, A&amp;amp;amp;A, 528, A75), and references therein).

The authors have used X-ray data to image the IBIS 90% error circle of all the AGN in the sample of 107, in order to obtain the correct X-ray counterparts, locate them with arcsecond accuracy and therefore pinpoint the correct optical counterparts. This procedure has led to the optical and spectral characterization of the entire sample. This new set consists of 34 broad line or type 1 AGN, 47 narrow line or type 2 AGN, 18 blazars and 8 sources of unknown class. These eight sources have been associated with AGN from their positional coincidence with 2MASX/Radio/X-ray sources. Seven high-energy emitters have also been included since they are considered to be good AGN candidates. Spectral analysis has been already performed on 55 objects and the results from the most recent and/or best statistical measurements have been collected. For the remaining 52 sources, the authors report the spectral analysis for the first time in this work. They have been able to obtain full X-ray coverage of the sample making use of data from Swift/XRT, XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. In addition to the spectral characterization of the entire sample, this analysis has enabled the authors to identify peculiar sources and by comparing different data sets, highlight flux variability in the 2-10 keV and 20-40 keV bands. In the reference paper, the authors present the X-ray and optical follow-up work on 107 new AGN recently detected by INTEGRAL. Fortunately, they have been able to obtain full X-ray coverage of the entire sample making use of data from the Swift/XRT, Newton-XMM, and NuSTAR archives or through Swift/XRT follow-up observations that they triggered. The HEASARC notes that this table of AGN newly detected by INTEGRAL and not included in the original INTEGRAL IBIS AGN Catalog (Malizia et al. 2012, MNRAS, 426, 1750, available at the HEASARC as the INTIBISAGN table) actually contains 108 AGN plus 8 candidate AGN, for a total of 116 objects, rather than the 107 plus 7 candidate AGN totalling 114 objects that are quoted in the abstract of the reference paper (and stated above).

With these corrections, the XLF is well reproduced by a single unbroken power law with a slope of -1.3 down to their threshold luminosity of ~ 3 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;37&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; ergs s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;. NGC 1316 was observed for 30 ks on 2001 April 17 (ObsID 2022), with the Chandra Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS). The authors used the back-illuminated (BI) CCD S3 (CCD ID 7) because of its sensitivity at low energies. To include NGC 1317 (6.3 arcminutes away from NGC 1316) in the same S3 chip, a small offset was applied to the SIM (Science Instrument Module) position. NGC 1316 was kept close to on-axis to achieve the best spatial resolution. To detect X-ray sources, the authors used WAVDETECT, a wavelet detection algorithm available in CIAO. They set the WAVDETECT significance threshold parameter to be 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-6&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;, which corresponds to 1 possibly spurious source, and the scale parameter to cover seven steps between 1 and 64 pixels. This made them sensitive to sources ranging from point-like to 32 arcseconds in size, and in particular accommodates the variation of the point-spread function (PSF) as a function of the off-axis angle of the sources. To extract source properties (such as count rates, spectra, etc.), the authors used the 95% encircled energy (at 1.5 keV) radius centered at the WAVDETECT centroid, with a minimum of 3 arcseconds to accommodate the radial variation of he PSF. Background counts were determined locally for each source from an annulus from 2 to 5 times the source radius, after excluding nearby sources. Extended sources were found at the locations of NGC 1316 and NGC 1317. In addition, the Chandra observations reveal 94 sources (the HEASARC notes that 95 are contained in this table), 83 of them in CCD S3. Of these, 81 sources (77 in S3 and 4 in S2) are within the D&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;25&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ellipse. The source density increases toward the center of NGC 1316, indicating that most of them are related to NGC 1316. Three sources are found within the D&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;25&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; ellipse of NGC 1317, with the brightest, extended one at the center of NGC 1317. The list of detected sources also includes sources found on CCDs other than S3 (CCD number 7). After correcting for effective exposure and vignetting, the X-ray flux in the 0.3 - 8.0 keV band is calculated with an energy conversion factor (ECF) assuming a power-law source spectrum with a slope of 1.7 and N&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;H&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; = 3 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;20&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;; ECF = 6.037 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-12&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; ergs per 1 count s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; for the back-illuminated (BI) chips and 9.767 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-12&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; ergs per 1 count s&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-1&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; for the front-illuminated (FI) CCD chips.

The mission was primarily designed to study the variability of X-ray sources on time scales from sub-milliseconds to years. The maneuvering capability of the satellite combined with the high photon throughput of its main detector (PCA) and high quality of background prediction (thanks to PCA intrumental group of LHEA, GSFC) has also made it possible to construct maps of the sky in energy band 3-20 keV. During its life time RXTE/PCA has collected a large amount of data from slew observations covering almost the entire sky. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; We have utilized the slew parts of all RXTE/PCA observations performed from April 15, 1996-July 16, 2002 which amounts in total to approximately 50,000 observations. The exposure time at a given point in the map is typically between 200-500 seconds. The observational period before April 15, 1996 (High Voltage Epochs 1 and 2) was excluded from the analysis because during that time the PCA had significantly different gain and dependence of the effective area on energy. The data reduction was done using standard tools of the LHEASOFT with a set of packages written by M. Revnivtsev (HEAD/IKI, Moscow; MPA, Garching).&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The survey has several features. It has strongly different exposure times at different points on the sky that lead to strong variability of the statistical noise on images. Because of that the only meaningful representation of images is the map in units of statistical significance. After the detection of a source flux can be determined from the map in the &apos;flux&apos; units. Map resolution is determined mainly by the slew rate of the RXTE (&amp;amp;amp;lt;0.05-0.1&amp;amp;amp;amp;#176;;/sec) and the time resolution of used data (16 sec, Std2 mode of the PCA). Sources can be detected down to the level of ~6e&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-12&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; erg/s/cm&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, but at this level the confusion starts to play an important role.

Swift/BAT is a wide field-of-view (70x100 degrees) hard X-ray imager consisting of a coded mask and large array of CdZnTe detectors (5000 cm&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;). The primary purpose of BAT is the detection gamma-ray bursts and the BAT survey data is collected during the search for gamma-ray bursts. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; BAT is sensitive in the energy range 14-195 keV. The data from the first 9 months of the survey is divided into 4 energy channels: 14-24, 24-50, 50-100, and 100-195 keV. Each of these is represented as separate survey, and an averaged survey over all bands is also given. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The all sky maps are presented in two forms, the significance maps and the flux maps. The significance maps are the count rate divided by the noise (sigma RMS) in a region of the map around the position. The noise is variable across the sky due to variable exposure and systematic noise. The noise is Gaussian and and the significances can be interpreted with the usual Gaussian probabilities. A threshold of 4.8 sigma for the blind detection of sources in the BAT survey corresponds to about 1 false detection on the whole sky. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The BAT flux map is scaled from the Crab rate in the survey and normalized to an assumed Crab spectrum of 10.4 E&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-2.15&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; photons.cm&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;/sec/keV. Due to the large number of randomly distributed gamma-ray burst pointings that contribute to any point in the image, this is an accurate characterization for the whole sky.

NuSTAR operates in the band from 3 to 79 keV, extending the sensitivity of focusing far beyond the ~10 keV high-energy cutoff achieved by all previous X-ray satellites. The inherently low background associated with concentrating the X-ray light enables NuSTAR to probe the hard X-ray sky with a more than 100-fold improvement in sensitivity over the collimated or coded mask instruments that have operated in this bandpass. Using its unprecedented combination of sensitivity and spatial and spectral resolution, NuSTAR will pursue five primary scientific objectives: (1) probe obscured active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity out to the peak epoch of galaxy assembly in the universe (at z &amp;amp;lt;~ 2) by surveying selected regions of the sky; (2) study the population of hard X-ray-emitting compact objects in the Galaxy by mapping the central regions of the Milky Way; (3) study the non-thermal radiation in young supernova remnants, both the hard X-ray continuum and the emission from the radioactive element &amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;44&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;Ti; (4) observe blazars contemporaneously with ground-based radio, optical, and TeV telescopes, as well as with Fermi and Swift, to constrain the structure of AGN jets; and (5) observe line and continuum emission from core-collapse supernovae in the Local Group, and from nearby Type Ia events, to constrain explosion models. During its baseline two-year mission, NuSTAR will also undertake a broad program of targeted observations. The observatory consists of two co-aligned grazing-incidence X-ray telescopes pointed at celestial targets by a three-axis stabilized spacecraft. Deployed into a 600-km, near-circular, 6&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;o&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; inclination orbit, the observatory is performing consistent with pre-launch expectations. NuSTAR is now completing its primary science mission, and with an expected orbit lifetime of 10 yr, the opportunity for proposing observations as part of the guest observer program is now available, with observations beginning in 2015. This table contains a list of (a) unobserved targets that are planned or have been accepted for observation by NuSTAR in the future and (b) NuSTAR observations which have been processed and successfully validated by the NuSTAR Science Operation Center. The data from these observations may or may not be public.

Using an SBIG STL-11000 camera, 70 fields (each covering 40x27 degrees) were imaged from dark-sky locations in Smellinger\\.xml\\.outh Africa, Texas and Michigan. In order to increase the dynamic range beyond the 16 bits of the camera&apos;s analog-to-digital converter (of which approximately 12 bits provide data above the noise leve) three different exposure times (240s, 15s and 0.5 s) were used. Five frames were taken for each exposure time and filter setting. The frames were photometrically calibrated using standard catalog stars and sky background data from the Pioneer 10 and 11 space probes. the panorama has an image scale of 36&quot;/pixel and a limiting magnitude of approximately 14. The survey has an 18 bit dynamic range. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; The processing of these data used a custom data pipeline built using IRAF, Source Extractor and SWarp. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; The data used here were converted to three independent RGB color planes of 8 bits each and provided to SkyView as a single 36000x18000x3 Cartesian projection cube. To allow users to efficiently sample data in a region of the sky, this cube was broken up into 2100x2100 pixel regions with a 50 pixel overlap between adjacent images. Tiles at the poles were 2100x2050. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; In &amp;amp;lt;i&amp;amp;gt;SkyView&amp;amp;lt;/i&amp;amp;gt; each color plane comprises a survey. The individual planes may be sampled as surveys independently as Mellinger-R, Mellinger-G and Mellinger-B. The color mosaics can be regenerated by creating an RGB image of all three surveys.

Many non-image data products are available at the WISE site. Note that WISE data is distributed in relatively large (&amp;amp;amp;gt;50 MB) image files. When SkyView generates an image for a part of the sky where it has not yet cached the data from the IPAC server there may be a delay as full tiles are downloaded even when only a small fraction of a tile is needed. Images in cached regions, are generated much faster. Access to the WISE data uses the VO SIA interface maintained at IPAC. Even when data is cached, the SIA service must still be available for successful queries.</td><td>https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=wise&amp;amp;</td><td>https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>simpleimageaccess</td></tr>\n",

This caused the CDS software to treat such pixels as missing rather than 0 exposure. &amp;amp;lt;li&amp;amp;gt; The counts data was extracted from the counts maps for each observation using &amp;amp;lt;i&amp;amp;gt;SkyView&amp;amp;lt;/i&amp;amp;gt; developed software. For any pixel in which a count was recorded, the corresponding exposure file was checked and if there was any exposure (in any of the associated extensions), then the count was retained. If there was no exposure in any of the extensions of the corresponding exposure file, the counts in the pixel were omitted. Once a count was accepted, the overlap between the counts map pixel and the pixels of the corresponding HiPS tile (or tiles) was computed. Each count was then assigned entirely to a single pixel in the HiPS tile randomly but with the destination pixel probabilities weighted by area of the overlap. Thus if several pixels were found in a given counts map pixel they might be assigned to different pixels in the swiftxrt\\.xml\\.output image. The HiPS pixels (~1.6&quot;) used were of substantially higher resolution than the XRT resolution of 18&quot; and somewhat higher than the counts map resolution of 2.36&quot;. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; A total of 183,750,428 photons were extracted from the counts maps while 15,226 were rejected as being from pixels with 0 exposure. There were 501 pixels which required special treatment as straddling the boundaries of the HEALPix projection. &amp;amp;lt;li&amp;amp;gt; The resulting counts tiles were then clipped using the exposure tiles that had been previously generated. Basically this transferred the coverage of the exposure tiles to the counts tiles. Any counts pixel where the corresponding exposure pixel was a NaN was changed to a NaN to indicate that there was no coverage in this region. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; During the clipping process 137,730 HiPS level 8 were clipped (of 786,432 over the entire sky). There were 12,236 tiles for which there was some exposure but no counts found. During the clipping process 2 photons were found on pixels where there was no corresponding exposure in the exposure tiles. This can happen when the pixel assignment process noted above shifts a photon just swiftxrt\\.xml\\.outside the exposed region but should be -- as it was -- rare. These photons were deleted. &amp;amp;lt;li&amp;amp;gt; After creating the clipped level 8 counts maps, level 7 to 3 tiles and an all sky map where generated by averaging pixels 2x2 to decrease each level. When adding the four pixels in the level N map together only pixels whose value was not NaN were considered. &amp;amp;lt;li&amp;amp;gt; Finally an intensity map was created by dividing the counts tiles by the exposure tiles. To eliminate gross fluctuations due to rare counts in regions with very low exposure, only regions with exposure &amp;amp;gt; 1 second were retained. A total of 30 photons were deleted due to this criterion. &amp;amp;lt;/ul&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; Note that while any sampler may in principle be used with these data, the Spline sampler may give unexpected results. The spline computation propogates NaNs thought the image and means that even occasional NaNs can corrupt the swiftxrt\\.xml\\.output image completely. NaNs are very common in this dataset. Also, if the region straddles a boundary in the HEALPix projection, the size of the requested input region is likely to exceed memory limits since the HiPS data are considered a single very large image.</td><td>https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=swiftxrt&amp;amp;</td><td>https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>simpleimageaccess</td></tr>\n",

The rotation transforms the HEALPix pixels from diamonds to squares so that the boundaries of the pixels are treated properly. The special HealPixImage class is used so that SkyView can use the HEALPix FITS files directly. The HealPixImage simulates a rectangular image but translates the pixels from that image to the nested HEALPix structure that is used by the HEALPix data. Users of the SkyView Jar will be able to access this survey through the web but performance may be poor since the FITS files are 150 to 600 MB in size and must be completely read in.

The range of optical and UV filters can accomodate wavebands between 1700 and 6500 Angstroms. A full field image covers 17x17 arcminutes and at maximum spatial sampling is imaged onto 2048x2048 0.5&quot; pixels. A 1000 second observation can detect point sources to m=22.3 when no filter is used. The Swift Serendipitous Source Catalog (Page et al., 2015) detects sources down to m=23-26 for the six filters in very deep observations, but the typical limits are substantially brighter (~20-23 magnitude). &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; These surveys are mosaics of all Swift UVOT observations released between the start of the mission and July 2017. Data were extracted from the HEASARC archive from the UVOT products directory. Mosaics are provided in six filters and also with no filter, i.e., WHITE. The table below gives the number of observations and bandpasses for each of the filters. For each UVOT observation standard processing generates a counts and exposure file as a single multi-extension FITS file with a separate extension for each filter. To aid processing, these extensions were copied into separate files in directory trees for each filter. Four observations in which the exposure and counts maps did not agree on the filters used were omitted from the processing. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; Some observations were recorded with 0.5&quot; pixels while others were binned to 1&quot;. All 0.5&quot; observations (typically fewer than 10%) were rebinned to the larger pixels for the counts maps since the counts data scales with the pixel size. Since the exposure values are intensive and do not vary significantly based upon the resolution, these data were not generally rebinned unless it was needed to ensure that Order 9 Hips data were produced. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; The CDS Hipsgen software was used to generate Order 9 HiPS data (~0.8&quot; pixels) for both the Counts and Exposure images. The HiPS (Hierarchical Progressive Survey VO standard) supports multi-resolution mosaics. Any quantitative use of these images should note that the rebinning increases the total counts by a factor of ~(1.0/0.8)^2 ~ 1.56. This software uses a bilinear interpolation to generate HEALPix tiles of an appropriate order (18 in this case). &amp;amp;lt;i&amp;amp;gt;SkyView&amp;amp;lt;/i&amp;amp;gt; developed software was used to divide the level 9 counts maps tiles by the corresponding exposure maps to create intensity tiles. Pixels where the exposure was less than 5 seconds were left as NaNs. The lower order (8 to 3) order intensity tiles were then generated by averaging 2x2 sets of the higher order maps treating any missing maps or pixels as NaNs. A HiPS all-sky image was generated by averaged the Order 3 tiles. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; Only the Intensity HIPS files are presented in the SkyView web page directly, but intensity, counts and exposure maps are available for all seven filters. Note that unlike the XRT HiPS data, the exposure and counts maps have not been clipped. I.e., the source FITS files have been aligned with the coordinate system and thus contain large numbers of unexposed pixels with 0 values. These 0&apos;s are simply propogated to HiPS tiles. NaNs are returned in regions which lie swiftuvot\\.xml\\.outside any of the original source images.

(e.g., BAT-snr-1 or BAT SNR 1 or BAT SNR 14-20, or BAT-Flux-1, ...). An additional summed survey, BAT-SNR-SUM or BAT SNR SUM or BAT SNR 14-195, is also available, but there is no summed flux survey. In our Web interface only the SNR surveys are shown in the Web form. Users can get flux maps corresponding to a given SNR image from the results pages. The batch interfaces may directly query any of the surveys since the user chooses the names explicitly rather than from a selection box. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; The values displayed in the significance maps are the local signal to noise ratio in each pixel. The noise in these coded-mask images follows a Gaussian distribution with center at zero and a characteristic width (sigma) of 1.0. The noise is calculated locally for each pixel by measuring the RMS value of all pixel values in an annulus around each pixel and hence includs both statistical and systematic components. Known sources are excluded from the annuli. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; The signal in each pixel is taken from the flux maps. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; The flux values are in the native BAT survey units of counts/sec/detector. The detector is an individual piece of CZT in the BAT array with an area of 1.6 x 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-7&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;m&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; While the Swift mission is primarily designed to follow gamma-ray bursts, the random distribution of bursts in the sky means that these survey&apos;s sky coverage is relatively uniform with the exposure at any point varying between abbat\\.xml\\.out 6 to 16 megaseconds. The survey limits for source detection are abbat\\.xml\\.out 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-11&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; ergs/s/cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; over abbat\\.xml\\.out half the sky and 1.3x10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-11&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; ergs/s/cm&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; over 90%. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; These data replace the 9-month BAT datasets which we have retired. If you wish access to the older data please let us know. Note that for the 9-month data we provided access through the web page to the flux data and gave links to the signal-to-noise maps. Since the existence of sources is most easily seen in the SNR maps, we decided to invert that for this release. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; For the 8 band data, the source data were provided by the BAT team as 6 FITS files. Each of these contained the 8 bands in separate image extensions for a region centered at l=0,b=+/-90 or l=0,90,180,270,b=0, the centers of 6 cubic facets. However these data are not the classical cube-faced projections, e.g., as used in COBE data. The data on the facets overlap, so that this is just a convenient way to tile the sky. &amp;amp;lt;i&amp;amp;gt;SkyView&amp;amp;lt;/i&amp;amp;gt; separated each of the FITS image extensions into a separate file, but no other modifications were made to the data. The summed image was provided as six separate files.</td><td>https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=bat-flux-1&amp;amp;</td><td>https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>simpleimageaccess</td></tr>\n",

NEAT is designed to look for potentially hazardous asteroids, i.e., those whose orbits cross the Earth&apos;s.

Only data within a single NEAT image will be displayed. The system attempts to find the most recent image within which has a offset in both RA and Dec of less than 0.8 degrees. If no such image is found, then an image with the minimum offset is returned, or the search may fail altogether if there are no nearby plates. The NEAT telescope uses an array of 4 CCDs. The backgrounds of the CCDs may differ significantly. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; The NEAT survey covers approximately 30% of the sky. Extreme southern and low-Galactic latitude regions are unsurveyed. Coverage is otherwise particularly dense in the ecliptic plane. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; NEAT data consists primarily of groups of three images taken with separations of 20 minutes and almost identical positions. &amp;amp;lt;i&amp;amp;gt; SkyView &amp;amp;lt;/i&amp;amp;gt; will normally return the last of a &apos;triplet&apos;. The SkyMorph site can be used to display an overlay of triplets to look for targets which moved during the interval between images. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; A catalog of objects detected in the NEAT/SkyMorph pages is accessible through the SkyMorph pages. &apos;Light-curves&apos; from all images during which an object was in the NEAT field of view can also be generated. &amp;amp;lt;P&amp;amp;gt; The NEAT data values are in arbitrary density units.

One of the main instruments of the observatory was the French-Soviet hard X-ray coded mask telescope SIGMA (Paul et al.1 1991, Adv.Space Res., 11, 279). It was the first space telescope that used coded aperture technique for reconstruction of sky images in hard X-rays (35-1300 keV). The angular resolution of the telescope was approximately 12&apos; and the accuracy of a source localization is approximately 2-3&apos;.&amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; SIGMA discovered numerous interesting hard X-ray sources including GRS 1758-258, which is located only 40&apos; from bright soft X-ray source GX 5-1. It detected hard X-ray flux from X-ray burster A1742-294, which is very near to bright black hole binary 1E1740.7-2942. SIGMA set an upper limit on the hard X-ray flux of from the central supermassive black hole in our Galaxy.&amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; During the period 1990-1998 SIGMA observed more that one quarter of the sky with sensitivity better than 100 mCrab. The Galactic Center region had the deepest exposure ( approximately 9 million sec), with the sensitivity to a source discovery (S/N &amp;amp;amp;gt; ~ 5) or approximately 10 mCrab.&amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; A list of all detected sources with references to publications on them is presented in the paper of Revnivtsev et al. 2004, Astr. Lett. v.6. In these survey images (40-100 keV) all performed observations are averaged together. Transient sources that were discovered by SIGMA may not visible in the averaged image. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; This survey has some features that users should keep in mind. The SIGMA telescope is a complicated instrument and is strongly dominated by the accuracy of the background subtraction. The presence of a very bright source in the field of view of the telescope sometimes cannot be fully accounted for and as a result of it some &apos;ghost&apos; sources can appear. Such features can be seen in the regions near very bright sources like Crab Nebula, Cyg X-1, Nova Per 1992, Nova Mus 1991, Nova Oph 1993, and in the Galactic Center region. In addition to its nominal field of view (~17x17 deg) located around the optical axis of the telescope, SIGMA had another window of relatively high transparency of its shield, approximately 20-30&amp;amp;amp;amp;#176; apart from the optical axis. Becuase of this a very bright sources like Cyg X-1 can cause non zero illumination of the SIGMA detector if they are located approximately 20-30&amp;amp;amp;amp;#176; from the optical axis. The ring-like features caused by this effect, can be seen around Cyg X-1, and Nova Per 1992. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; The count rate of detected sources (or upper limits) can be roughly translated into mCrab using the fact that that Crab nebula gives the count rate approximately 2.8e&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;-3&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; cnts/s in the units, provided in &apos;flux&apos; maps</td><td>https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/sia.pl?survey=granat&amp;amp;</td><td>https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>simpleimageaccess</td></tr>\n",

The mission was primarily designed to study the variability of X-ray sources on time scales from sub-milliseconds to years. The maneuvering capability of the satellite combined with the high photon throughput of its main detector (PCA) and high quality of background prediction (thanks to PCA intrumental group of LHEA, GSFC) has also made it possible to construct maps of the sky in energy band 3-20 keV. During its life time RXTE/PCA has collected a large amount of data from slew observations covering almost the entire sky. &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; We have utilized the slew parts of all RXTE/PCA observations performed from April 15, 1996-July 16, 2002 which amounts in total to approximately 50,000 observations. The exposure time at a given point in the map is typically between 200-500 seconds. The observational period before April 15, 1996 (High Voltage Epochs 1 and 2) was excluded from the analysis because during that time the PCA had significantly different gain and dependence of the effective area on energy. The data reduction was done using standard tools of the LHEASOFT with a set of packages written by M. Revnivtsev (HEAD/IKI, Moscow; MPA, Garching).&amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; The survey has several features. It has strongly different exposure times at different points on the sky that lead to strong variability of the statistical noise on images. Because of that the only meaningful representation of images is the map in units of statistical significance. After the detection of a source flux can be determined from the map in the &apos;flux&apos; units. Map resolution is determined mainly by the slew rate of the RXTE (&amp;amp;amp;lt;0.05-0.1&amp;amp;amp;amp;#176;;/sec) and the time resolution of used data (16 sec, Std2 mode of the PCA).

In these cases the source appears fuzzy due to the poor resolution of ROSAT near the edge of the field of view. This comes at the cost of a substantial reduction in the fraction of the sky covered. Counts and exposure maps are included for users who may need this information (&amp;amp;lt;i&amp;amp;gt;e.g.&amp;amp;lt;/i&amp;amp;gt;, to do statistical analysis). &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; The global organization of the surveys is similar to the IRAS survey.

Each of the simultaneous modes is listed in separate records within this table. For a given time interval, there are several records (partially overlapping in time), each describing a single configuration/mode. The BAT modes collect data for the entire FOV but also have the capability to record rates (tag mask rate) for up to a few specific sky positions (typically 3) that correspond to a pre-assigned target ID. It is possible that at least two or more of these positions do not coincide with the BAT or NFI pointing position and therefore the target ID does necessarily coincide with Target_ID of the BAT or NFI pointing position. This table records for the position (RA and Dec) and Target_ID parameters the correct values associated to each of the mask tag data.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xamin/vo/ssa?table=swiftbalog&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/swiftbalog.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>simplespectralaccess</td></tr>\n",
