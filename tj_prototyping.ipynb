       "<tr><td>gamma-ray</td><td>Swift</td><td>ivo://nasa.heasarc/swiftmastr</td><td>This table records high-level information for each Swift observation and provides access to the data archive. Each record is associated with a single observation that contains data from all instruments on board Swift. The BAT is the large field of view instrument and operates in the 10-300 keV energy band. The narrow field instruments, XRT and UVOT, operate in the X-ray and UV/optical regime, respectively. An observation is defined as a collection of snapshots, where a snapshot is defined as the time spent observing the same position continuously. Because of observing constraints, the length of a snapshot can be shorter than a single orbit and it can be interrupted because the satellite will point in a different direction of the sky or because the time allocated to that observation ends. The typical Swift observing strategy for a Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) and/or afterglow, consists of a serious of observations aimed at following the GRB and its afterglow evolution. This strategy is achieved with two different type of observations named Automatic Targets and Pre-Planned Targets. The Automatic Target is initiated on board soon after an event is triggered by the BAT. The Figure of Merit (FOM) algorithm, part of the observatory&apos;s autonomy, decides if it is worth requesting a slew maneuver to point the narrow field instruments (NFI) on Swift, XRT and UVOT, in the direction of the trigger. If the conditions to slew to the new position are satisfied, the Automatic Target observation takes place; all the instruments have a pre-set standard configuration of operating modes and filters and about 20000 seconds on source will be collected. The Pre-Planned Target observations instead are initiated from the ground once the trigger is known. These observations are planned on ground and uploaded onto the spacecraft.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=swiftmastr&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/swiftmastr.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

For each trigger there are associated up to 14 messages, however not all are always generated and sent on ground. The messages are generated on board by the BAT, XRT and UVOT instruments and the Figure of Merit part of the observatory&apos;s autonomy. The BAT and XRT can each have five different message types. The UVOT and FOM can each have two different message types. These TDRSS messages are the results of the on-board data processing of the three instruments and some contain data products. They are first distributed via the GCN and later archived. The BAT messages are: alert, &apos;ack&apos; containing the position, or &apos;nack&apos; if the position could not be calculated, a lightcurve and scaled map. The XRT messages are: centroid containing the position, an image (if the position has been calculated), centroid error if the position could not be calculated, spectra in Low Rate Photodiode and Windowed Timing modes, a lightcurve. The UVOT messages are: finding chart containing star positions and a subimage centered on the XRT position. The FOM messages are used to indicate if the FOM will or will not observe the new target and if the spacecraft will (or will not) request a slew for the new target. The parameters in this database table are a collection of high level information taken from the following messages : the BAT alert, &apos;ack&apos; or &apos;nack&apos; message, the FOM messages, the XRT position and image.

       "<tr><td>gamma-ray#radio#x-ray</td><td>RSSGRBAG</td><td>ivo://nasa.heasarc/rssgrbag</td><td>This table contains a catalog of radio afterglow observations of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) over a 14 year period from 1997 to 2011. This sample of 304 afterglows consists of 2,995 flux density measurements (including upper limits) at frequencies between 0.6 GHz and 660 GHz, with the majority of data taken in the 8.5-GHz frequency band (1,539 measurements). The authors use this dataset to carry out a statistical analysis of the radio-selected sample. The detection rate of radio afterglows stayed unchanged almost at 31% before and after the launch of the Swift satellite. The canonical long-duration GRB radio light curve at 8.5 GHz peaks at three to six days in the source rest frame, with a median peak luminosity of 10&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;31&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; erg/s/Hz. The peak radio luminosities for short-hard bursts, X-ray flashes, and the supernova-GRB classes are an order of magnitude or more fainter than this value. There are clear relationships between the detectability of a radio afterglow and the fluence or energy of a GRB, and the X-ray or optical brightness of the afterglow. However, the authors find few significant correlations between these same GRB and afterglow properties and the peak radio flux density. In their paper, they also produce synthetic light curves at centimeter and millimeter bands using a range of blast wave and microphysics parameters derived from multi-wavelength afterglow modeling, and use them to compare with the radio sample. Finding agreement, the authors extrapolate this behavior to predict the centimeter and millimeter behavior of GRBs which will observed by the Expanded Very Large Array and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. The compiled sample consists of 304 GRBs observed with radio telescopes between 1997 January and 2011 January, along with the 2011 April 28 Fermi burst, GRB 110428A. The sample consists of a total of 2,995 flux density measurements taken in the frequency range from 0.6 to 660 GHz and spanning a time range from 0.026 to 1,339 days. Most of the afterglows (270 in total) in this sample were observed as part of VLA radio afterglow programs, whereas 15 bursts were observed by the Expanded VLA (EVLA), and 19 southern bursts with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). This catalog describes the radio, optical and X-ray afterglow detections (see Section 2.2 of the reference paper): out of the 304 bursts, 123 bursts were observed in the pre-Swift epoch from 1997 until 2004. The remaining 181 bursts were observed between 2005 and 2011 April (the post-Swift epoch). Out of the 95 radio-detected afterglows (see Section 2.2 of the reference paper), 63 had radio lightcurves (i.e., three or more detections in a single radio band), whereas 32 bursts had less than three detections. For the GRBs for which the light curves were available, the authors determined the peak flux density and the time of the peak in the VLA frequency bands (i.e., 1.4 GHz, 4.9 GHz, 8.5 GHz, 15 GHz, and 22.5 GHz bands) by fitting the data with forward shock formula of the form (Frail 2005, IAU Coll. 192, p. 451) given in equation (1) of the reference paper. This formula may not accurately represent the full complexity of the radio lightcurve evolution. However, it is good enough to determine the approximate values for the peak flux density F&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;m&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; and the time of the peak t&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;m&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;. See the discussion in Section 3.5 of the reference paper for more details and some caveats. For the remaining bursts, the flux density values were taken directly from the data, and hence do not have the best-fit errors for the peak flux, peak time and rest-frame peak time parameters F&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;m&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;, t&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;m&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt; and t&amp;amp;lt;sub&amp;amp;gt;m&amp;amp;lt;/sub&amp;amp;gt;/(1+z), respectively.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=rssgrbag&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/rssgrbag.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",

LLE data are generated for a given position in the sky (RA, DEC) and for a given interval of time (T0, T1) corresponding to the GBM Burst. The standard LLE selection applied to the downloaded events is the following: (FswGamState==0 &amp;amp;amp;&amp;amp;amp; TkrNumTracks&amp;amp;gt;0 &amp;amp;amp;&amp;amp;amp; (GltEngine==6 || GltEngine==7) &amp;amp;amp;&amp;amp;amp; EvtEnergyCorr &amp;amp;gt; 0) &amp;amp;amp;&amp;amp;amp; (FT1ZenithTheta&amp;amp;lt;90.0) &amp;amp;amp;&amp;amp;amp; (FT1Theta&amp;amp;lt;=90.0) &amp;amp;amp;&amp;amp;amp; (((cos(FT1Dec*0.0174533)*(FT1Ra - (RA)))&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt; + (FT1Dec - (DEC))&amp;amp;lt;sup&amp;amp;gt;2&amp;amp;lt;/sup&amp;amp;gt;) &amp;amp;lt; PSF(EvtEnergyCorr, Theta) where &amp;amp;lt;pre&amp;amp;gt; * FswGamState is the status of the Flight Sofware Gamma filter. We require that the event is a gamma-ray (FswGamState==0). * TkrNumTracks is the number of tracks in the tracker. We require that there is at least one track. This requires the event to have a reconstructed direction. * GltEngine is the status of the &amp;amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://oraweb.slac.stanford.edu/pls/slacquery/DOCUMENTS.DetailedIndex?PROJECT=GLAST&amp;amp;P_DOC_ID=776972&quot;&amp;amp;gt;Global LAT Trigger&amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;gt;. We require that GltEngine equals 6 or 7, which corresponds to taking all the events that trigger in the tracker TKR but did not have a region of interest (ROI) associated (GltEngine 7) or all the events that pass the CalHI (at least 1 GeV in one crystal). * EvtEnergyCorr is the best estimation of the reconstructed energy, especially at low energy. * Theta is the reconstructed source direction (Theta) with respect the LAT boresight. * PSF(EvtEnergyCorr, Theta) represents the functional form of the containment radius of the Point Spread Function (PSF) of the LAT. &amp;amp;lt;/pre&amp;amp;gt; The exact cut used to select the events is saved in the keyword LLECUT in the primary header of each LLE file. If the GBM catalog position of the burst is updated (due to a refined localization from LAT or Swift or from subsequent on ground analysis), the LLE data are automatically updated and new versions of the LLE files are produced. In some cases, LLE data are manually generated (using a better localization which may or may not have been used in the GBM Trigger Catalog). For each updated position, the version of the corresponding LLE files increases by one. There are six FITS files provided for each entry: the LLE event file, the time-binned spectrum (CSPEC) file, the CSPEC response (RSP) file, and the extracted burst spectrum (the PHA-I file) for the entire duration of the burst, an LLE event file with same time cut as the RSP and PHA-I files, and a LAT pointing and livetime history file. There are six FITS files provided for each entry: the LLE event file (gll_lle_bnNNNNNNNNN_vMM.fit), the time-binned spectrum (CSPEC) file (gll_cspec_bnNNNNNNNNN_vMM.pha), the CSPEC response (RSP) file (gll_cspec _bnNNNNNNNNN_vMM.rsp), and the extracted burst spectrum (the PHA-I file) for the entire duration of the burst (gll_pha_bnNNNNNNNNN_vMM.fit), an LLE event file with same time cut as the RSP and PHA-I files (gll_selected_bnNNNNNNNNN_vMM.fit), and a LAT pointing and livetime history file (gll_pt_bnNNNNNNNNN_vMM.fit). The LLE event file format is similar to the LAT photon file format with some exceptions. Because the LLE data are tightly connected to a particular object (position and time), the FITS keyword OBJECT has been added to the file. Generally, OBJECT will correspond to the entry of the GBM Trigger Catalog used to generate LLE data and corresponds to the &amp;amp;quot;name&amp;amp;quot; column in the FERMILLE table (and in the GBM Trigger Catalog table). For similar reasons, the position of the object used to select LLE file is written in the header of each extension of each LLE file. PROC_VER corresponds to the iteration of the analysis of LLE data. PASS_VER corresponds to the iteration for the reconstruction and the general event classification (Pass6, Pass7, etc.). VERSION corresponds to the version of the LLE product for this particular event. The update of a location of a GRB will increase the number of VERSION in the file, but will leave the PASS_VER and PROC_VER unchanged. The CSPEC file is obtained from directly binning the TTE files. It provides a series of spectra, accumulated every second, from -1000 to 1000 seconds around the burst. Each spectrum is binned in 50 energy channels, ranging typically from 10 MeV to 100 GeV. The format of the CSPEC file is tailored to satisfy rmfit standards, and it is not directly usable in XSPEC. The CSPEC Response file (the RSP file) is the detector response matrix calculated from Monte Carlo simulation, and it corresponds to a single response matrix for each Gamma-Ray Burst or Solar Flare. The PHA-I file contains the count spectrum. The PHA-I file is created from the same time interval used to compute the response matrix. The selected events file is identical to the LLE event file with an additional time selection applied to match the cut used to compute response matrix and PHA-I files. The LAT pointing and livetime history file is identical to the standard LAT file but with entries every second (instead of every 30 seconds). It spans 4600 seconds before and 4600 after the trigger time.</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/vo/cone/coneGet.pl?table=fermille&amp;amp;</td><td>https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/fermille.html</td><td>NASA/GSFC HEASARC</td><td>conesearch</td></tr>\n",
