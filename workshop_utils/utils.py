def download_file(url, directory=None, filename=None, verbose=False):
    """
    Download a file from the specified URL, making a best guess at the
    output file name when no file name specified.  The logic works as
    follows:

       - If filename is specified, then that filename is used.
       - If filename is not specified, but the http response
         from the URL has a content-disposition that suggests
         a filename, then use that.
       - If filename still isn't know, extract the base filename
         from the URL and use that.

    Parameters
    ----------
    url : str
        This URL from which to retrieve the file.
    directory : str
        The directory to which to write the file.  If not specified,
        the file will be written to the current working directory.
        May not be specified if filename contains a directory path.
    filename : str
        The filename to which to write the file.  When specified,
        the file will be written to that name.  filename may contain
        a directory path only if the directory param is not specified.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        The output path to which the file was written.
