# aas_workshop_2018_summer
Workshop resources for summer AAS meeting 2018
NASA's Astrophysics Archives preserve many terabytes of multiwavelength
  images, catalogs, and spectra. While many astronomers are familiar
  with the web tools that are convenient for searching and visualizing
  these data, this workshop will introduce participants to the
  command-line data access tools that are becoming increasingly
  popular. We will use Python to work through science scenarios
  that combine multiwavelength data from the HEASEARC, IRSA, NED,
  and MAST.
